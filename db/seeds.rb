  {title: "Interview with Ali Dayan Hasan, Pakistan Director, Human Rights Watch", image: "image/upload/v1501076811/interview-with-ali-dayan-hasan-pakistan-director-human-rights-watch.jpg", body: "<p>It is not really a law that is used against suspected terrorists. It \r\nis a law that is used against all manner of people for all manner of \r\npurposes. Under the military regime of General Musharraf, it was used \r\nagainst political opponents. To date, it is used by the Pakistani state \r\nagainst political opponents, nationalists in Baluchistan. It is used to \r\nsettle property disputes. The Anti-Terrorism Act is used in all sorts of\r\n ways.</p><p>The interesting thing is that only a fraction of those \r\napprehended or arrested for terrorism-related offenses are tried—if \r\never—under the Anti-Terrorism Act. Why is that? It is because \r\ncounterterrorism in Pakistan occurs below the radar, it occurs in an \r\nextra-legal fashion. So you have a situation where, in the valley of \r\nSwat, where in 2009 the Pakistani military conducted a fairly successful\r\n operation, one that, certainly even by our standards, in the active \r\nphase of the operation minimized violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law.</p><p>But since then, there are some 3000 Taliban and \r\nAl Qaeda suspects—Taliban suspects mostly—that have been held in illegal\r\n military detention. These individuals are in a legal black hole. They \r\nhave not been tried under the Anti-Terrorism Act; they have not been \r\nprocessed under the Anti-Terrorism Act. Essentially, what ends up \r\nhappening is that you have this draconian law, which is used as an \r\ninstrument of coercion otherwise, and you have terror suspects who are \r\nnever brought into the legal system at all. What you are doing is \r\ntherefore creating a system of endemic lawlessness. There is no way that\r\n the Pakistani state can hope to establish its writ in the valley of \r\nSwat or elsewhere in a sustainable manner, if it does not extend the \r\nbenefits of the rule of law, which is the first sign of a functional \r\nstate to the people of Swat, who actually turned to the Taliban because \r\nthere was a legal vacuum in the first place.</p><p>So, the point is that the Anti-Terrorism Act is bad, and it is misused.</p><p><strong>AW:</strong>\r\n You said in an interview this April that segments of Pakistan’s media \r\nhave played a role in inciting violence by expressing extreme \r\nnationalist and discriminatory views. As Pakistan Director at Human \r\nRights Watch, how do you see the balance between the media’s rights to \r\nfree expression and the control of inciting violence?</p><p><strong>AH:</strong>\r\n I think free speech is indivisible, and the right to free speech cannot\r\n be compromised, and really free speech can only be combated with more \r\nfree speech. I would certainly not propagate any kind of curbs on free \r\nspeech. However, incitement to violence is a criminal offense, and those\r\n who incite violence, who incite murder–and there are very many of those\r\n in Pakistan–should be held accountable under the law.</p><p>What the \r\nPakistani state has done is that it has sought to muzzle criticism. In \r\nthe media it has, for example, sought to muzzle critique of abuses in \r\ncounter-terrorism operations, of abuses by the military, and the \r\nintelligence agency the ISI. But it has allowed free reign to extremist \r\ngroups that have fomented hatred, that have fomented violence, that have\r\n targeted members of society–vulnerable groups, whether it is women, or \r\nthe poor, or religious minorities, or political figures who have spoken \r\nup for those vulnerable groups.</p><p>When that has happened, the \r\nstate–which ought to use the full might of the law to end that \r\nincitement to violence to hold those accountable who incite violence and\r\n murder–has failed. That failure is what bothers me.</p><p>The media has\r\n equally been complicit in such activity, and where the media is \r\ncomplicit in incitement to violence, where it is complicit in incitement\r\n to murder, where this is documented, the media should not be above the \r\nlaw, as should no other sector of society.</p><p>I think that’s what \r\nit’s about; this is not about media freedom, it’s about criminality: how\r\n you are going to combat criminality and how you can’t be selective \r\nabout combating criminality because it suits you, or you lack the will, \r\nor are too frightened, or are an ineffectual governing authority. That \r\nis not a valid excuse. It is the job of the state to take responsibility\r\n and enforce rights-respecting rule of law.</p><p><strong>AW:</strong> \r\nMoving on to a different type of media, what role do you see social \r\nmedia playing in Pakistani society? Are youths in Pakistan using \r\nFacebook and Twitter to the same extent as their peers in other parts of\r\n the world, and are they using social media for political purposes?</p><p><strong>AH:</strong>\r\n I think social media is increasingly important within the Pakistani \r\ncontext, but there is an important distinction between the use of social\r\n media, in, say, the Arab world during the Arab Spring, and in a place \r\nlike Pakistan. Arabic is one of the languages of the Internet. Arabic is\r\n also the principal language of countries in the Arab world. Now, this \r\nis not the case in a country like Pakistan where there isn’t linguistic \r\nuniformity. And also, the capacity to communicate through the Internet \r\nis limited, because of limited software in the Urdu language, and \r\nlimited awareness of the Latin script, which is used otherwise to do it.</p><p>However,\r\n Twitter certainly is something that is very, very useful. It’s a very \r\nuseful medium. It is certainly something that many of us are using, and \r\nit is a great tool of quick information dissemination in real-time. Of \r\ncourse, because Pakistan is a quick learner in many ways, mediums like \r\nTwitter are also being used by people to spread an anti-rights agenda, \r\nto spread disinformation. You find a whole subculture of people on \r\nTwitter who refer to themselves as Twitter activists. Nobody knows who \r\nthese people actually are, and they will use the language of human \r\nrights and the rule of law to actually spread anti-rights agendas to \r\ndiscredit bona fide human rights organizations.</p><p>So there is, in \r\nfact, very positive uses that you can put the social media to, and of \r\ncourse, equally you use it for propaganda, counter-uses that are \r\nnecessarily not desirable.</p><p><strong>AW:</strong> Finally, what are \r\nyour views on the chances to achieve wider reconciliation in Pakistan? \r\nHow can a new peaceful consensus be forged that includes all groups? In \r\nthis context, how do you view the recent offer by the Pakistani Taliban \r\nto negotiate a peace deal with the Government of Pakistan?</p><p><strong>AH:</strong>\r\n It is certainly my view, and it is the view of any human rights \r\nactivist, that peace should be affected through a process of \r\nreconciliation. But that peace has to be affected in a rights-respecting\r\n manner. It cannot be affected at the cost of human rights. It cannot be\r\n affected by letting human rights abusers go scot free.</p><p>People who\r\n have committed abuses have to be held accountable for those abuses. If \r\nthose are people within the Pakistani state, they should be held \r\naccountable; if they are non-state actors, such as the Taliban, or \r\nsections of the Taliban, they should be held accountable. The idea that \r\nyou can affect a peace by turning a blind eye to rampant human rights \r\nabuse is a hoax. It is something ultimately that will backfire on those \r\nmaking the peace.</p><p>So, absolutely, there has to be of some kind of \r\nrapprochement in the Pakistan Afghanistan region. All stakeholders \r\nshould be brought into the equation, but those within current Afghan \r\ngovernment, the current Pakistani government, the Taliban, Al Qaeda, who\r\n have committed serious human rights abuses—in many instances which \r\namount to war crimes—should be held accountable. A peace without \r\naccountability is a peace that is bound to fail.</p><p><strong>AW:</strong> Thank you Mr. Hasan, for taking the time to speak with us today.</p>", author_id: 4, category_id: 7, deleted: false, slug: "interview-with-ali-dayan-hasan-pakistan-director-human-rights-watch"},

But earlier today the Immigration \r\nMinister, Peter Dutton, said none of them will come to Australia.<br><br>PETER\r\n DUTTON, IMMIGRATION MINISTER: Those people on Manus who have come by \r\nboat will not settle permanently in Australia. And I can't be any \r\nclearer than that and I want people to hear that very clear message.<br><br>MATT\r\n WORDSWORTH: Labor's immigration spokesman Richard Marles also said the \r\nasylum seekers and refugees should not be moved to Australia, but \r\ncriticised the Government for taking too long to process the group. <br><br>RICHARD\r\n MARLES, OPPOSITION IMMIGRATION SPOKESMAN: But offshore processing as \r\nLabor envisaged it was about processing and then resettlement. It was \r\nnever about indefinite detention, which is effectively what's occurred \r\non Manus; or indefinite limbo, which is what's occurred on Nauru.<br><br>MATT\r\n WORDSWORTH: Meanwhile, an Iranian refugee on Nauru is being airlifted \r\nto Australia tonight, after setting himself on fire as part of a \r\nprotest. The Immigration Minister said the man was in a very serious \r\ncondition.<br><br>Kenneth Roth is the executive director of Human Rights Watch. He's currently in Australia and he joined me a short time ago.<br><br>Ken Roth, thanks for being on Lateline. <br><br>KENNETH ROTH, EXEC. DIRECTOR, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH: My pleasure. <br><br>MATT WORDSWORTH: What's your reaction to the impending closure of the Manus Island Regional Processing Centre? <br><br>KENNETH\r\n ROTH: Well, you know: thank God it's finally happening. I mean, \r\nAustralia policy has basically been to make life so miserable for the \r\nasylum seekers in Manus and Nauru that they ultimately just go back \r\nhome.<br><br>Ostensibly, there's a right to asylum. Ostensibly, they can\r\n seek refuge in these islands. But in fact, they either are detained or \r\nthey're left into societies that are so inhospitable to them that they \r\nsee that they really don't have a choice there; they can't make a life \r\nthere. And so they're in desperate situations.<br><br>I spoke to a \r\ncouple of people who were both from Syria who were saying, you know, \"My\r\n only choice is to go back to ISIS. My only choice is to go back to \r\nAssad's prison camps, where I face torture and prosecution.\" You know, \r\nand that was the awful choice that Australia was imposing on these \r\npeople.<br><br>So I'm happy that this option - you know, this pretending\r\n to comply with the Refugee Convention while in fact giving these people\r\n no choice - I'm happy that this seems to be the beginning of the end of\r\n that policy. <br><br>MATT WORDSWORTH: The prime minister, Peter \r\nO'Neill, says that he's respecting the decision of the Supreme Court. \r\nWere you surprised that the court ruled in that way? <br><br>KENNETH \r\nROTH: You know, it was... I was surprised. But I was very happy because,\r\n frankly, a fair assessment of the policy would have led to the court's \r\nruling.<br><br>In other words: there is nothing illegal about seeking asylum. This is recognised in international law.<br><br>A\r\n very large percentage of asylum seekers arrive without visas. You're \r\nnot supposed to detain them. Australia flouted those rules: stuck them \r\nnot only in detention but in detention in this faraway island, where \r\nthere was, you know, an inhospitable population around them and no \r\nprospect of a normal life.<br><br>And for the court initially to say \r\nthat there's no justification for that detention was absolutely right. \r\nThat's international law.<br><br>And for the prime minister then to say,\r\n you know, there's not a big difference between being technically \r\ndetained and being technically free to run around tiny Nauru, where most\r\n of the population doesn't want you and most of the detainees are afraid\r\n to even leave the detention facility: that's just recognising reality.<br><br>This is an illegal, inappropriate, inhumane policy and I'm glad it's coming to an end. <br><br>MATT\r\n WORDSWORTH: Do you think, though, that there could be any reworking of \r\nthe arrangement in Papua New Guinea so as not to offend the constitution\r\n and keep that regional processing? Or do you think it's just: it's all \r\nover?<br><br>KENNETH ROTH: Well, the prime minister did say that those \r\nasylum seekers who wanted to stay: you know, who were found to be \r\ngenuine refugees - and a very significant percentage of them are found \r\nto be refugees as they slowly make their way to the process - that those\r\n who want to stay in PNG can. You know: and great.<br><br>But I think \r\nthe vast majority won't. What they found is that they face violence. \r\nThey face a population that doesn't really want them. They face very few\r\n prospects for jobs, for making a life.<br><br>This is not where they want to be. And so I think almost all of them will choose to come back to Australia. <br><br>MATT\r\n WORDSWORTH: Well, the prime minister there, Peter O'Neill, says \r\nAustralia's got to make its own arrangements now. Are you concerned \r\nabout what Australia's next move might be? <br><br>KENNETH ROTH: I have \r\nto say, coming to Australia - and I visit regularly - I'm struck by the \r\nway that policy here has been made through kind of cheap sloganeering.<br><br>You\r\n know, there is talk about: \"Oh, these people are queue-jumpers.\" But in\r\n fact, there's no queue to jump. There is such a small number of people \r\nwho are resettled from refugee populations around the world that these \r\nare basically desperate people who want some kind of refuge. So there's \r\nno queue-jumping.<br><br>They talk about how, you know, this is somehow a way to fight people smuggling. That's, you know, this nefarious word.<br><br>But\r\n basically, people smugglers provide a fee for service. You know, this \r\nis different from trafficking. If there's coercion involved, they should\r\n be pursued. But people smugglers are basically, you know, Qantas \r\nwithout a visa. They're desperate people who want to get to Australia. \r\nThere's nothing wrong with that.<br><br>MATT WORDSWORTH: Even if it's organised crime, bribery of officials, that sort of thing? <br><br>KENNETH\r\n ROTH: Well, I mean, for the most part it's just really taking a boat \r\nand bringing them close to Australia. Now, obviously the more that there\r\n is violence or coercion involved, that becomes trafficking. But most \r\npeople smuggling is just fee for service. Now, you know, the ultimate \r\nargument...<br><br>MATT WORDSWORTH: But some of these people smugglers, \r\nto be fair, put them on very dangerous boats that sometimes sink. And \r\nthe Immigration Minister, Peter Dutton, often says: \"Look, there were \r\n1,200 deaths under the previous system of processing; no deaths under \r\nthis one.\" Is that a compelling argument for you? <br><br>KENNETH ROTH: \r\nIt's a very narrow perspective, because what he's not asking is: How \r\nmany lives are being lost by people who don't really have an option of \r\nseeking refuge, because the boats have been cut off?<br><br>So, you \r\nknow, there are 400,000 people who have lost their lives in Syria. How \r\nmany of them might have been saved, had they been able to flee in this \r\ndirection?<br><br>Or what about the people who, you know, were put in \r\nPNG or put in Nauru and who, because they were facing a life of \r\nindefinite detention, went back to life under the Taliban? Went back to \r\nIraq? Went back to Syria? We don't count those lives lost.<br><br>So to \r\ntake this narrow perspective and say, \"Oh, people are drowning at sea\": \r\nthose drownings are terrible. If you want to stop that, have a much more\r\n generous refugee admission policy.<br><br>The thing that's striking is \r\nthat, even at the height of the boat crisis, you know, there were \r\nbasically 30,000 people who came to Australia in the course of a year. \r\nThat's roughly 10 per cent of the regular, authorised migration to \r\nAustralia.<br><br>So in other words: if you were to bump up that regular\r\n migration by 10 per cent, you would barely notice it. It'd be a blip. \r\nAnd suddenly, people wouldn't have to take to sea. They would have a \r\nlawful way to come.<br><br>And you could set up screening areas in \r\nIndonesia or elsewhere in South-East Asia: screen out the security \r\nthreats, screen out the economic migrants, but let in through a refugee \r\nresettlement process the people who deserve to be able to be given some \r\nkind of asylum. <br><br>MATT WORDSWORTH: And how do you stop people \r\ngetting on the boats? What: presumably have Navy, Coast Guard patrolling\r\n the seas between Java and Christmas Island?<br><br>KENNETH ROTH: Well, \r\nobviously if you are actively patrolling to save lives, rather than to \r\nprotect borders, that's a good thing. You can pick people up...<br><br>MATT WORDSWORTH: So you think you could solve that problem of deaths at sea? <br><br>KENNETH\r\n ROTH: I mean, Italy did that. Frontex did that. They radically reduced \r\nthe deaths at sea by more vigorously patrolling - to save lives, rather \r\nthan to protect borders.<br><br>But the way you avoid getting people on \r\nboats in the first place is to give them a light at the end of the \r\ntunnel: to make refugee resettlement from places like Indonesia a \r\nrealistic option.<br><br>And so if Australia was concerned about saving lives, it would increase its refugee resettlement. <br><br>MATT\r\n WORDSWORTH: So at the same time, on Nauru we've seen a 23-year-old \r\nIranian man set himself alight; four other people apparently drink \r\nwashing powder. At the same time, the Minister, Peter Dutton, says UNHCR\r\n representatives were on the island.<br><br>Do you think those incidents\r\n coincided and were related; that the people, the asylum seekers knew \r\nthey were there and were sending a message?<br><br>KENNETH ROTH: I mean,\r\n I have no idea. Were they sending a message? I mean, probably it was \r\nsome combination of utter desperation and sending a message.<br><br>You \r\nknow, what does it take to self-immolate? It takes complete despair. It \r\ntakes, you know, seeing a life before you which is no life: basically \r\nbeing, in the case of Nauru, held on this tiny little island of 10,000 \r\npeople, with no prospect of an ordinary life: or, go back to Syria, go \r\nback to the Taliban.<br><br>You know, what kind of awful choice is that?\r\n Can you imagine being forced with that choice? That's the kind of thing\r\n that lead people to self-immolation or to other self-destructive acts. <br><br>MATT\r\n WORDSWORTH: Now, just before we run out of time: we're heading into a \r\nfederal election campaign. Both major parties, Coalition and Labor, are \r\ncommitted to off-shore processing. What does the international human \r\nrights community make of that?<br><br>KENNETH ROTH: Well, it depends what you mean by off-shore processing.<br><br>In\r\n other words: if you set up transit camps in, say, Indonesia, where \r\npeople can show up, they can work, they can send their kids to school, \r\nthey have a decent life; and then you screen people there, you process \r\nthem there; and those found to be legitimate refugees, you resettle \r\nthem: that's great.<br><br>But if you mean punitive off-shore \r\nprocessing, where you basically dump them in a detention centre, make \r\nlife utterly miserable and hope that they just go back to Syria: that's a\r\n blatant violation of international law. <br><br>MATT WORDSWORTH: The \r\nfact that both sides will not allow asylum seekers to be resettled in \r\nAustralia: that's the... the offensive...?<br><br>KENNETH ROTH: Well, I \r\nmean, that's the sad state of Australian politics: where the demagogues \r\nhave prevailed for the moment. I hope that both parties take this \r\ncourageous act by PNG as an opportunity to reassess what has been an \r\nillegal and inhumane policy and recognise that, at this point, there \r\nreally is no option but to allow people to seek asylum in Australia.<br><br>And\r\n if you don't want them to get on boats, give them an opportunity to be \r\nscreened in Indonesia or elsewhere and move them in an orderly way \r\nthrough a resettlement process.<br><br>MATT WORDSWORTH: Ken Roth, thanks very much for being on Lateline. <br><br>KENNETH ROTH: Thank you.<br>\r\n", author_id: 5, category_id: 7, deleted: false, slug: "interview-kenneth-roth-executive-director-of-human-rights-watch"}

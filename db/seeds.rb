In contrast with the spheres of private rights and private welfare (the family and civil society), the state is from one point of view an external necessity and their higher authority; its nature is such that their laws and interests are subordinate to it and dependent on it. On the other hand, however, it is the end immanent within them, and its strength lies in the unity of its own universal end and aim with the particular interest of individuals, in the fact that individuals have duties to the state in proportion as they have rights against it (see § 155).\r\n\r\nThe foregoing paragraph advises us that concrete freedom consists in the identity (as it is supposed to be, two-sided) of the system of particular interest (the family and civil society) with the system of general interest (the state). The relation of these spheres must now be determined more precisely.\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view the state is contrasted with the spheres of family and civil society as an external necessity, an authority, relative to which the laws and interests of family and civil society are subordinate and dependent. That the state, in contrast with the family and civil society, is an external necessity was implied partly in the category of ‘transition’ (Übergangs) and partly in the conscious relationship of the family and civil society to the state. Further, subordination under the state corresponds perfectly with the relation of external necessity. But what Hegel understands by ‘dependence’ is shown by the following sentence from the Remark to this paragraph:\r\n\r\n§ 261.... It was Montesquieu above all who, in his famous work L’Esprit des Lois, kept in sight and tried to work out in detail both the thought of the dependence of laws in particular, laws concerning the rights of persons - on the specific character of the state, and also the philosophic notion of always treating the part in its relation to the whole.\r\n\r\nThus Hegel is speaking here of internal dependence, or the essential determination of private rights, etc., by the state. At the same time, however, he subsumes this dependence under the relationship of external necessity and opposes it, as another aspect, to that relationship wherein family and civil society relate to the state as to their immanent end.\r\n\r\n‘External necessity’ can only be understood to mean that the laws and interests of the family and civil society must give way in case of collision with the laws and interests of the state, that they are subordinate to it, that their existence is dependent on it, or again that its will and its law appear to their will and their laws as a necessity!

It’s like bringing to \r\nlife the written texts of a convention or law. Some of the atrocities \r\nour world has paid greatest attention to are the ones that had a picture\r\n or video showing the extent of violation. These images drive down the \r\nmessage and get people uncomfortable to the point of action and that is \r\nexactly what we need as a human rights community – to provoke people to \r\ntake a stand against injustice.

While \r\nhuman rights defenders go about protecting the rights of others, they \r\nare constantly at risk of arrests, torture, and even death.

The Master’s programme in Conflict Studies and \r\nHuman Rights focuses on studying and engaging contemporary conflict and \r\nassociated human rights issues.</p>\r\n<p>Current realities have forced the international community to address \r\ncontemporary conflicts with a combination of military, humanitarian, \r\npolitical, economic, and development-related measures. So far, however, \r\nthe record of conflict management has been mixed. Notwithstanding \r\nincidental successes, there have been several less successful attempts \r\nand even outright failures.</p>\r\n<p>This highlights the need to better understand the nature of \r\ncontemporary conflict, and to ground this understanding in empirical \r\nresearch and theoretical explanations. Apart from a better understanding\r\n of conflict per se, there is also a lack of trained personnel in this \r\nrapidly growing professional field. It is against this backdrop that \r\nUtrecht University offers a one-year selective international Master’s \r\nprogramme in Conflict Studies and Human Rights.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on this programme and on how to enroll, see <a href=\"http://www.uu.nl/university/masters/NL/conflictstudies/Pages/default.aspx?refer=/NL/Informatie/master/conflictstudies\">here</a>.</p>", author_id: 3, category_id: 5, deleted: false, slug: "ma-conflict-studies-and-human-rights"},

In this way, the first\r\n global standard for preventing and addressing the risks of adverse \r\nimpacts on human rights linked to business activities has been \r\nestablished. The adoption of the Guiding Principles marked the start of \r\nmultifaceted implementation processes at the international and domestic \r\nlevels, including the United Nations Forum on Business and Human Rights,\r\n the activities of the Working Group on Business and Human Rights of the\r\n Human Rights Council, the development of national action plans on \r\nbusiness and human rights in countries from all regions, and numerous \r\ninitiatives on the part of the business community and civil society.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In 2015, <strong>the Diplomatic Conference organised by EIUC and the EU Working Party on Human Rights (COHOM)</strong>\r\n was dedicated to the topic: “Business and Human Rights – the (EU) way \r\nahead of multilateral action.” A particular focus of this Conference was\r\n placed on the EU reaction at that stage to the Human Rights Council \r\nresolution adopted at its twenty-sixth session on the initiative of \r\nEcuador and South Africa with a view to elaborating an international \r\nlegally binding instrument on transnational corporations and other \r\nbusiness enterprises with respect to human rights.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In the previous debates, even those who were skeptical \r\nabout a single overarching treaty on business and human rights, as it \r\nwould be too abstract and not very useful to people, recognised that \r\nsome issues might benefit from further international standard-setting, \r\nsuch as access to remedies, harmonisation of state regulation of \r\nbusiness accountability, including extra-territorial reach for domestic \r\nremedies or modes of liability for business entities. This would be \r\ncompatible with the vital role and the impact of the Guiding Principles \r\nsince they “<em>are a floor, not a ceiling</em>.” (John Ruggie).</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In this spirit, <strong>the 2017 Diplomatic Conference</strong>&nbsp;revisited\r\n the issue of an international treaty in light of the evolution of \r\ndiscussions. The topic is highly relevant and timely given that the \r\nthird session of the Inter-Governmental Working Group on transnational \r\ncorporations and other business enterprises with respect to human rights\r\n will take place in October 2017 and may begin negotiations on the \r\ncontent of a new instrument. The forthcoming Diplomatic Conference \r\noffered a conducive framework for a reflection among COHOM members and \r\nother EU officials, supported by the expertise of high level experts on \r\nbusiness and human rights. Its first part (morning) was dedicated to the\r\n scope and key substantive aspects of the treaty proposal, as well to \r\nthe EU engagement in the relevant processes. It is widely acknowledged \r\nthat the implementation of the third pillar of the UNGPs i.e. on access \r\nto remedies for victims of violations of human rights committed in the \r\ncontext of business activities, has been the weakest as compared to the \r\nother pillars. Undoubtedly, any proposal for a legally binding \r\ninstrument will place a strong emphasis on the access of individuals and\r\n groups to tools and procedures enabling them to claim their rights and \r\nhold those responsible accountable. Therefore, the afternoon session of \r\nthe Diplomatic Conference addressed contentious and/or unpacked human \r\nrights aspects of the right to remedy. <br></p>", author_id: 3, category_id: 2, deleted: false, slug: "diplomatic-conference-business-and-human-rights-the-right-to-a-remedy"},

  {title: "The Object of Law", image: nil, body: "<p class=\"fst\"><em>The Object</em> of Law is one of the basic systematic\r\n concepts of jurisprudence, and is closely linked with the concept of a \r\nlegal relationship and a legal subject. “Every real law is a law of some\r\n thing.” (Korkunov) The object of law, as an abstract and general \r\nconcept, is not related to any one branch of law. Nevertheless, and in a\r\n similar way to the majority of juridic categories, it has the clearest \r\nand most specific meaning in civil law and, particularly, in property \r\nrelationships. It is relatively easy to see what the object of law is in\r\n property or the law of mortgage, or inheritance law. But jurists have \r\nhad great debates concerning the nature of this concept in franchise \r\nqualifications, for example, or in citizenship. These difficulties have \r\nconvinced some of the existence of non-objective law (Becker).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The abstract notion of the object of law was virtually absent for \r\nRoman jurists – with their pragmatic and non-philosophical minds. It was\r\n replaced by the more concrete category of the “thing” (res), and even \r\nhuman slaves were regarded as this. The power of the head of household \r\nover his wife and children (<em>patria potestas</em>) was closely linked\r\n to the law of things according to their formal juridic basis. For a \r\nconcrete understanding of the object of law, the absence of an abstract \r\nnotion of subjective law among the Romans fully corresponds with the \r\nprecise form of action – <em>actio</em>. Hence, Roman authors established systematic subunits of persons (<em>personae</em>), things (<em>res</em>) and actions (<em>actiones</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roman jurists displayed some talent for generalization by subdividing\r\n things, as objects of law, into the corporeal (corporalia) and the \r\nnon-corporeal (<em>incorporalia</em>). This distinction applied, for example, to the rights of inheritance and the exercise of the right to agricultural produce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The development of exchange relationships advanced the actions of the\r\n responsible person as a special legal concept. The law of things and \r\nthe law of obligation were combined into the general notion of property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The doctrine of the object of law assumed an abstract character with \r\nthe development of the abstract doctrine of subjective law-representing \r\nthe universal capacities of the persona-in the bourgeois jurisprudence \r\nof the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. At this stage in the \r\ndevelopment of juridic thought, a whole series of problems arose that \r\nwere difficult to resolve. First, attempts were made to depict objects \r\nas so-called public subjective rights; and second, there was a desire to\r\n construct a legal system based on the idea of norms (understood as \r\nimperatives). But if the basis of law is an imperative and the \r\nobligation which arises from that imperative, then, for example, the \r\nobject of the right of property does not logically represent the thing \r\nitself with its specific use and exchange-value, but something negative:\r\n the restraining actions of all other people which hinder the owner in \r\nthe possession, use and disposal of his property.</p>\r\n\r\nSuch dogmatic formal constructions-juridic categories – devoid of \r\neconomic meaning – are typical of the present time when the dominant \r\nrole in bourgeois jurisprudence, particularly, in the elaboration of \r\ngeneral questions, has. passed from the civilists to the publicists.", author_id: 2, category_id: 6, deleted: false, slug: "the-object-of-law"},
  {title: "Lenin and Problems of Law", image: nil, body: "<h4>Introductory Note</h4>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\"><em>The following essay was Pashukanis’ earliest attempt to seek anticipatory support for the serious implications of <strong>The General Theory of Law and Marxism</strong>,\r\n in Lenin’s voluminous yet fragmented writings on law. It was written in\r\n the context of two unresolved questions in the indecisive period after \r\nLenin’s death in 1924. What form ought to be attached to the content of \r\nParty rules and directives? What ought to be the attitude of the Party \r\nand the Soviet proletariat towards the demand for the right of nations \r\nto self-determination? And, of course, within the framework of the \r\ndebates between Bukharin, Trotsky and Stalin concerning centralization \r\nand the doctrine of socialism in one country, these questions were not \r\nentirely unrelated. Pashukanis argues that a revolutionary Party must \r\nfollow a course which avoids the dangers both of the complete rejection \r\nof legal struggle and of the fetishism attached to legal rules. Legality\r\n is not an “empty sack” that can be filled with a new class content \r\nimmediately after the revolution, and under the New Economic Policy the \r\nlegal form must be used as a weapon in a programme of cultural \r\nre-education. Pashukanis’ response to these questions appeared in a \r\nspecial collection entitled <strong>Revolution of the Law</strong>, \r\nwhich was edited by Stuchka and included such distinguished theorists as\r\n Bukharin, Adoratsky and Razurnovsky. This collection was intended as \r\nthe first systematic expression of the Marxist jurists.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Lenin, although a jurist by education, never devoted \r\nspecial attention to problems of law. From this, one could draw the \r\nrather hasty conclusion that such a category should receive no attention\r\n at all in the systematic study of his immense ideological legacy. \r\nHowever, this would be incorrect. To begin with, a series of isolated \r\nobservations and thoughts relating to law are scattered throughout his \r\nwork. They merely need to be extracted, sorted and systematized. Lenin’s\r\n contribution to this subject, insufficiently developed by Marxists, can\r\n only be evaluated after this task is accomplished. In addition, not all\r\n of what Vladimir Ilich wrote in the Soviet period, not directly \r\nintended for publication, has yet been published, i.e. his writings \r\nrelating to the practical problems of constructing the Soviet state \r\nwhich have been preserved in the form of numerous directive notes and \r\nletters to individual comrades, as well as every possible type of order,\r\n instruction etc. Only when all of this material is systematized and \r\npublished will we be able to conceive a truly comprehensive idea of what\r\n Leninism means for the problems of law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the present article, naturally, we do not expect to achieve the \r\nexceptional results of work which would require substantial and, \r\nprobably, collective efforts. But one point should be made at this \r\njuncture. One can obtain a much more correct Marxist and dialectical \r\napproach to the problems of law from Lenin, who did not write especially\r\n on law, than from other Marxists who especially dedicated themselves to\r\n these questions. To prove my point, I will give one example. The \r\nproblem concerns one of the basic legal institutions: the institution of\r\n private property. Certain Marxists, following Renner’s example, present\r\n the dialectic of this institution in an entirely simplistic manner:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">In the age of isolated and closed natural economy, the\r\n right of ownership of things could actually be considered as the factor\r\n distinguishing different groups of people from each other. outsiders \r\nhad no relationships with these owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quote\">Exchange relationships between groups or their \r\nrepresentatives, exchange of surpluses of the natural economy, \r\ncontractual relationships connected with this exchange; in fact, these \r\ncan be the only elements linking individuals with one another. <a id=\"f1\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n1\" name=\"f1\">[1]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">It would seem that nothing could be simpler: the less \r\nthat exchange is developed and the less the role of the market, the more\r\n private property atomizes people, the more it is a relationship \r\n“between a man and a thing”, and the more it is the law of things. On \r\nthe other hand, the same author concludes, “capitalist private property \r\n... does not ‘atomize’ people, but strongly ‘unites’ them, and enchains \r\nthe workers if not to an individual capitalist, then at least to \r\ncapitalists as a group”. From this he concludes that “the difference \r\nbetween the law of things and the law of obligations, in particular in \r\nthe form which bourgeois jurisprudence gives it, corresponds not to the \r\ncapitalist system, but to the structure of the simple natural economy”. \r\nThis is an example of an extremely simplistic analysis – reputedly \r\nattributed to Marx, but in fact made by Renner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goikhbarg entirely fails to realize the dialectical possibility that \r\nin atomizing people, private property makes its appearance by uniting \r\nthem through exchange, through the market, according to the extent of \r\nthe disappearance of the natural economy and its replacement with a \r\ncommodity-money economy. However, in one of Lenin’s earliest works, we \r\nfind not only a clear understanding of the dialectic of private \r\nproperty, but also a correspondingly sharp formulation of it. Objecting \r\nto Mikhailovsky on the question of the nature of the right of \r\ninheritance, Lenin writes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">In fact, the institution of inheritance already presupposes private property and the latter arises <em>only with the appearance of exchange</em> [our italics, <em>E.P.</em>]\r\n The source of this was the specific nature of social labour and the \r\nalienation of commodities on the market which were already appearing. So\r\n long, however, as all the members of the primitive American Indian \r\ntribe jointly produced all their necessary products, private property \r\nwas impossible. When the division of labour penetrated the tribe, and \r\nits members individually began to engage in the production of an article\r\n and to sell it on the market, then the institution of private property \r\nappeared <em>as the expression of this material individualization of commodity producers”</em> [our italics, <em>E.P.</em>]. <a id=\"f2\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n2\" name=\"f2\">[2]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">The matter is therefore by no means so simple. The \r\nmaterialist nature of private property “isolating people” appears on the\r\n scene only when instead of the simple relation “between a man and a \r\nthing” (natural economy), a contractual relation among people emerges, a\r\n relation of exchange (commodity-money economy). The contradiction \r\nbetween the law of things and the law of obligations turns out to be, \r\naccording to the dialectic, contained in the single shell in which they \r\njointly developed, which to a certain extent appears as nothing other \r\nthan the contradiction between “the social nature of means of production\r\n and the private nature of appropriation” translated into legal \r\nlanguage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the strictly materialist character of property “isolating” people \r\nwas an attribute of the closed natural economy, it would follow from \r\nthis that, for example, feudal ownership of land must have been more \r\nexclusive (excluding others, strangers) than bourgeois ownership. But, \r\nalas, this flatly contradicts historical facts. Listen to what one \r\neminent historian of the civil legislation of the French Revolution says\r\n in this respect. This is how Sagnac characterizes the land \r\nrelationships of pre-revolutionary France:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">A right of ownership does not belong to only one \r\nperson, as in the Roman Empire; the different rights of which it \r\nconsists, instead of being collected in one bundle, are separated. On \r\nthe one hand, the right of direct possession remains in the grantor; on \r\nthe other hand, after the right of use has passed to the person to whom \r\nthis land is granted, then, because of centuries of evolution, it is \r\nconsidered not as a simple right of use but as a right of ownerships. <a id=\"f3\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n3\" name=\"f3\">[3]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">Thus, relationships that were semi-natural corresponded, \r\nso to speak, to the absence of a clearly distinct right to an object \r\n“gathered in one bundle”. But this is still not all. In the same Sagnac \r\nwe read further:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">If land belonged both to the lessee and lessor, in \r\nfact or in theory, then it also belonged in the general sense to all \r\npeople ... as soon as the harvest was collected the land became common \r\nto all. Poor people could go there, collect the fallen ears which they \r\nused for cows’ litter, for the roofing of homes or for heating the \r\nhearth ... afterwards each could pasture his cow and sheep on the \r\nunfenced lands; this was a free pasture. Certain customs allow owners to\r\n enclose only a small part of their estate so as to give the poor the \r\npossibility of pasturing their cows or goats. <a id=\"f4\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n4\" name=\"f4\">[4]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">These facts were not of course first discovered by \r\nSagnac. They were long known and characterized, among others, even by \r\nMarxists, as survivals of tribal property which were preserved in fact \r\nby the natural form of the economy. On the contrary, enclosure-the \r\nsymbol of an exclusive material right-was intensified by the development\r\n of a commodity-money economy, and by the transition from feudal to \r\ncapitalist exploitation. just consider the chapter in <strong>Das Kapital</strong>\r\n on primitive accumulation. The French Revolution effected a decree \r\npunishing the mere proposal of an agrarian (reform) law (i.e. division \r\nof the land) with death. At the same time strict decrees were adopted on\r\n the protection of land boundaries. Thus, the development of the market –\r\n the development of commodity-capitalist relations – leads precisely to \r\nthe situation whereby private property more and more clearly reflects \r\nits exclusive nature as a relationship “between man and an object”. This\r\n is despite, or more accurately because of, the fact that the natural \r\ndiversity of objects gives way to their impersonal expression in the \r\nform of a universal monetary equivalent. Property obtains a more perfect\r\n materialist character, then, with the freedom of appropriation and \r\nalienation. Land ownership obtains a fully materialist character when \r\nthe land becomes “immobile”, i.e. an object of exchange which is \r\ndistinct from other objects – an object only by the fact that it cannot \r\nbe transferred from place to place. In other words, the material \r\ncharacter of property corresponds not to natural-economic relationships \r\nbut in fact to the relationships of commodity-capitalist society. And \r\naccordingly, contrasting the law of things with the law of obligations, \r\nit in no way loses its meaning in the transition from the natural \r\neconomy to the commodity-money economy. But, on the contrary, for the \r\nfirst time it obtains its full meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same must also be said about the relationship between the \r\nexploited and the exploiter. Here also, the process of development is \r\nnot as simple and one-sided as Goikhbarg depicts it. Precisely because \r\nthe feudal economy was basically a natural one, feudal ownership of land\r\n could not adopt the perfected form of an exclusive right to an object. \r\nThe existence of peasant allotments – which destroyed this exclusivity –\r\n was also in fact an instrument of exploitation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">in order to obtain an income (i.e. surplus product) \r\nthe serf-owning landlord must have on his land a peasant who possesses \r\nan allotment, implements and livestock. A landless, horseless, \r\nnon-farming peasant is useless as an object of feudal exploitation. <a id=\"f5\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n5\" name=\"f5\">[5]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">But it was indeed from this that the enserfment of the peasant derived:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">the peasant who was allotted land must be personally \r\ndependent upon the landlord, because, having land, he will not perform \r\nlabour for his lord except by coercion. The economic system here \r\nengenders non-economic coercion, serfdom, legal dependence, lack of full\r\n rights etc. <a id=\"f6\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n6\" name=\"f6\">[6]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">Thus, we see that property in a semi-natural economy not \r\nonly “isolates”, as Goikhbarg thinks, but also very strongly binds – \r\n“attaches” – people, in the given case peasants, not only to the class \r\nof estate owners, but also to each individual estate owner. “On the \r\ncontrary, ‘ideal’ capitalism is the full freedom to contract in the free\r\n market-for the owner and proletarian.” <a id=\"f7\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n7\" name=\"f7\">[7]</a>\r\n The power of money appears most clearly in the contradiction between \r\nthe legal freedom of the parties in the market and the actual power of \r\ncapital, and it forms the structure of the bourgeois state in contrast \r\nto the feudal state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, one may object that all this is nothing new, just the ABCs\r\n of Marxism. In particular, the difference between the forms of feudal \r\nand capitalist exploitation, and the difference between the derivative \r\nforms of state, are sufficiently elucidated by Marx himself in the \r\nsecond part of Volume III of <strong>Das Kapital</strong>. Lenin’s \r\nformulation on this particular point merely repeats Marx. But it is all \r\nthe more unforgivable to disregard these truths when they are elementary\r\n and have been well-known for a long time. This is especially so if, in \r\nthe light of these truths, a picture of the development of law emerges \r\nwhich is much more complex than the one presented to us as the latest \r\nconclusions of Marxism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From this small example we can see that it is in fact much easier to “criticize this [i.e. legal – <em>E.P.</em>] mythology than to explain it from the economic relationships which engender it”. <a id=\"f8\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n8\" name=\"f8\">[8]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"link\">&nbsp;<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#top\">Top of the page</a><br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>II</h4>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">Lenin’s incomparable dialectic nowhere appears with such \r\nforce, perhaps, as in problems of law. It is particularly striking, \r\nsince one is compelled to compare it with the wretched formalism and \r\nfruitless scholasticism which usually flourishes here. We have in mind \r\nnot only the theoretical analysis of the legal superstructure, in which \r\nLenin appears as a true follower of Marx, but also Vladimir Ilich’s \r\npractical position in this area. Here we also encounter striking \r\nexamples of the purely Leninist dialectic. It is sufficient to observe \r\nin several specific cases the role that Lenin attributed to the legal \r\nform. He always did this by taking full account of the concrete \r\nhistorical situation, the relationship between the forces of the \r\nstruggling classes etc. to realize that both the fetishism of the legal \r\nform and its complete opposite the failure to grasp the real \r\nsignificance that one or another legal form may have at a given stage \r\nwere equally foreign to Vladimir Ilich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The struggle to overthrow and unmask the legalistic fetish of the \r\nsystem, against which the revolutionary struggle is conducted, is a \r\nquality of every revolutionary. This is obvious. Without this quality, \r\nthe revolutionary is not a revolutionary. But, for the petit bourgeois \r\nrevolutionary the very denial of legality is turned into a kind of \r\nfetish, obedience to which supplants both the sober calculation of the \r\nforces and conditions of struggle and the ability to use and strengthen \r\neven the most inconsequential victories in preparing for the next \r\nassault. The revolutionary nature of Leninist tactics never degenerated \r\ninto the fetishist denial of legality; this was never a revolutionary \r\nphrase. On the contrary, at given historical stages, he firmly appealed \r\nto use those “legal opportunities” which the enemy, who was merely \r\nbroken but not fully defeated, was forced to provide. Lenin knew not \r\nonly how mercilessly to expose tsarist, bourgeois etc. legality, but \r\nalso how to use it, where it was necessary and when it was necessary. He\r\n taught how to prepare the overthrow of the autocracy by using the very \r\nelectoral law promulgated by the autocracy itself, and how to defend the\r\n first positions won by the world revolution of the proletariat, i.e. \r\nour victory in October 1917, by concluding a treaty with one of the \r\nimperialist states (the Peace of Brest). His incomparable political \r\ninstinct unerringly guided him to an understanding of the limits within \r\nwhich it was fully possible to use the legal form imposed by the course \r\nof the struggle. Lenin brilliantly took into consideration the fact that\r\n the legality which our enemy imposes upon us is re-imposed on him by \r\nthe logic of events. The Stolypin regime, however much it wanted, could \r\nnot confine the class struggle in Russia inside those limits within \r\nwhich it was conducted before the 1905 revolution; the German \r\nimperialists, whatever their subjective dislike of the Soviet \r\nrevolution, were compelled by the force of the general international \r\nsituation to conclude a treaty with the Soviet government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lenin frequently characterized this use of legality as dirty, \r\nthankless work (his comparison of the tsarist Duma with “dirty bread” is\r\n famous), but it was necessary to know how to do this work in a certain \r\ntype of situation, and to put aside the kind of revolutionary \r\nfastidiousness which acknowledged only the “dramatic” methods of \r\nstruggle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the years of reaction (1907-1910), the Bolsheviks, compared \r\nwith other defeated opposition and revolutionary parties, “conducted the\r\n most orderly retreat with the least damage to their army”, “with the \r\nnucleus of their party best preserved, with the fewest and least harmful\r\n divisions, and with the least demoralization” etc. Lenin explained this\r\n primarily by the fact that the Bolsheviks “ruthlessly exposed and drove\r\n out the revolutionary phrasemongers who refused to understand that it \r\nwas necessary to retreat, that it was necessary to learn how to work \r\nlegally in the most reactionary parliaments, in the most reactionary \r\nprofessional, cooperative and similar organizations”. <a id=\"f9\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n9\" name=\"f9\">[9]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such major examples of Leninist strategy as the use of “legal \r\nopportunities”, or the Brest Peace, are sufficiently well known and have\r\n been more or less studied from the perspective of the political lessons\r\n which they contain. But until now little attention has been paid to the\r\n fact that both cases demonstrate recognition of the real significance \r\nof a type of legal form which is used in a specific situation, and as a \r\nwell-known and very necessary method of struggle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Lenin attacked those revolutionaries who, consoling themselves \r\nwith a revolutionary phrase, showed a lack of willingness or lack of \r\nability to learn how to apply this method of struggle in practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is remarkable that this tendency is observed in Lenin, not just on\r\n a large scale and in the major political struggles which he conducted, \r\nbut also in minor conflicts of an everyday character with which he \r\nhappened to be involved. Always remaining deeply committed to principle,\r\n Lenin nevertheless did not refuse to apply those concrete methods of \r\nstruggle which at a given point happened to be the only possible way to \r\nachieve a desired result – even though the method was, for example, an \r\nappeal to a tsarist court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here one must recall an episode from Lenin’s life told by Elizarov \r\nsoon after the death of Vladimir Ilich. The situation was that Vladimir \r\nIlich, who at the time was still living in Samara, wanted to teach a \r\nlesson to a high-handed profiteer, a purveyor of transportation, who \r\narbitrarily detained passengers who used the services of boatmen to \r\ncross the river rather than his ferry. He submitted a complaint, despite\r\n all the efforts of the head of the former district council (on behalf \r\nof the profiteer, naturally) to exhaust the indefatigable complainant by\r\n dragging out the hearing of the case; finally, a guilty verdict was \r\nobtained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this episode it is not only important for us that Lenin displayed \r\nin a minor matter the same stubbornness, iron will and firmness for \r\nwhich he was known in major matters. It was important that he knew, when\r\n he wanted to and when he found it necessary, how to set into motion \r\neven this method of struggle-he appealed to the tsarist court to teach \r\nthe petty tyrant a lesson in that particular matter and to protect the \r\ninterests of the poor boatmen. This would not have been surprising if \r\nLenin had belonged to that type of “social activist”, an outstanding \r\nrepresentative of which was, for instance, V.G. Korolenko. For them, \r\nsuch a struggle with the semi-serf Asiatic arbitrariness of the \r\nestate-owner state “in the name of legality” and strictly by legal \r\nmeans-was a sort of banner. No one mocked these people more caustically \r\nthan Lenin. But this indeed proves that Lenin was a master of this type \r\nof struggle if he could not get the result he sought by, so to speak, \r\ntaking a partisan position at the head of the struggle which he was \r\nconducting against autocratic arbitrariness and capitalist exploitation.\r\n Why, probably 99% of our good revolutionaries would have simply wrung \r\ntheir hands in this particular case and said, “It is not worth being \r\ninvolved”. And, of course, in so doing this would have reflected not \r\ntheir commitment to principle as revolutionaries, but simply a lack of \r\nknowledge of what had to be done and that it was necessary to act as a \r\nlawyer; and also, a lack of willingness because they were fastidious. \r\nWhat could be more favourable for a revolutionary than to go to court \r\nand, moreover, to appear before the head of local government. But Lenin \r\nwas not an idle dreamer; he knew how to do dirty work where it was \r\nnecessary. It is true in this case that it was also possible to \r\nconstruct an argument for the expediency of the route undertaken by \r\nVladimir Ilich. Was it worthwhile, in fact, to have spent time and \r\nenergy going to court with some individual profiteer? But this is \r\nanother example where what is debatable is not the question of \r\nexpediency, but the question of principle: should a revolutionary seek \r\nthe support of the Crown’s court? A certain individual who managed the \r\nKnowledge Publishing House committed a violation and was, therefore, \r\nsubject to the threat of a law-suit. In Lenin’s correspondence with \r\nGorky the question is considered, what practical steps should be taken? \r\nShould one appeal to the tsarist court; was this permissible? Obviously,\r\n the orthodox intellectual outlook, the fear of dirtying the clean \r\nclothing of the revolutionary by turning to the tsarist court, the \r\nfastidious anarchist relationship to courts in general, and, most of \r\nall, the usual legal impotence, the lack of knowledge of “how this is \r\ndone” – all these are arrayed against such a means of action. Lenin \r\nenergetically criticized this combination of visible and hidden motives:\r\n “With respect to P., I am for the court. There is no reason to stand \r\nupon ceremony. Sentimentality would be unforgivable. Socialists are by \r\nno means against the Crown’s court. We are for the use of legality. Marx\r\n and Bebel turned to the Crown’s court even against their socialist \r\nopponents. It is necessary to know how to do this, and it is necessary \r\nto do it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And not being satisfied with this avalanche, Vladimir Ilich again “presses” energetically: “P. <em>must be sued and with no holds barred</em>. If you are criticized for this – spit in the faces of the critics. To criticize would be hypocritical.” <a id=\"f10\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n10\" name=\"f10\">[10]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not known what happened to this P., and it seems that this case\r\n did not go to court. But it appears that were the matter up to Vladimir\r\n Ilich, P. would have been sued “without reservation”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed it is this aspect of Vladimir Ilich which must be compared \r\nwith this firm appeal-already another matter, in the situation of the \r\nSoviet state – to struggle against the violation of discipline, \r\nomissions, corruption and outrages; to struggle firmly, bringing it \r\ninevitably to an end, to court, to punishment. “How are officials \r\npenalized who have favored local conditions to the detriment of the \r\ncentre and in violation of orders from the centre? What are the names of\r\n those penalized? Is the frequency of these violations diminishing? Have\r\n the penalties been increased, and if so to what?” <a id=\"f11\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n11\" name=\"f11\">[11]</a>\r\n And further: “We must reorganize the Workers’ and Peasants’ \r\nInspectorate by calling non-Party members to account both through this \r\nInspectorate and also outside it through <em>judicial prosecution</em> [our italics – <em>E.P.</em>].” <a id=\"f12\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n12\" name=\"f12\">[12]</a>\r\n And also from the same order: “On measures of struggle with thieves: \r\nare they being held criminally accountable? The administration? The \r\nfactory and plant committees (for insufficient struggle with theft)?” <a id=\"f13\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n13\" name=\"f13\">[13]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time Lenin teaches anyone who points out a shortcoming of\r\n the Soviet mechanism that they must contribute to the struggle with all\r\n the methods provided by Soviet legality. Once a case is begun, bring it\r\n to an end, using all Soviet and Party channels. Do not be dissuaded by \r\nthe fact that you have suffered failure at first, do not be dissuaded by\r\n the fact that you do not know where to turn. Everyone is obliged to \r\nknow where and how to complain about an improper decision, and everyone \r\nis obliged to become a legally literate Soviet citizen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The knowledge of how to conduct a struggle on “legal ground”, which \r\nin the pre-revolutionary situation did not and could not have broad \r\nsignificance, in principle has a very different meaning after the \r\nOctober period. Under autocracy and under capitalism it was impossible \r\nto struggle with the legal impotence and juridic illiteracy of the \r\nmasses, without conducting a revolutionary struggle against autocracy \r\nand against capital: this impotence is but a partial phenomenon of the \r\ngeneral subjugation for whose maintenance tsarist and bourgeois legality\r\n existed. But after the conquest of power by the proletariat, this \r\nstruggle has the highest priority as one of the tasks of cultural \r\nre-education, as a precondition for the construction of socialism. \r\nTherefore, Lenin’s works from the Soviet period are simultaneously \r\n“anti-legal propaganda”, i.e. a campaign against bourgeois legal \r\nideology, and an appeal to struggle and to eliminate legal illiteracy \r\nand impotence:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">To the extent that the basic task of power becomes not\r\n military subjugation but rule the typical feature of subjugation and \r\ncoercion will become not instant execution, but the court. And in this \r\nrespect, after October 25, 1917, the revolutionary masses set forth on \r\nthe correct path, and they have shown the viability of the revolution by\r\n beginning to set up the workers’ and peasants’ courts even before any \r\ndecrees were issued on the dissolution of the bourgeois-democratic \r\njudicial apparatus, But our people’s and revolutionary courts are \r\nexceptionally and unbelievably weak. One senses that the popular feeling\r\n that these courts are governmental and alien-an attitude inherited from\r\n the yoke of the estate owners and bourgeoisie has still not yet been \r\nfinally destroyed. There is not a sufficient awareness of the fact that \r\nthe court is an <em>agency</em> of the power of the proletariat and of the poorest peasant, and that the court is an <em>educational weapon</em> for discipline. <a id=\"f14\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n14\" name=\"f14\">[14]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"link\">&nbsp;<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#top\">Top of the page</a><br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>III</h4>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">The petit bourgeois revolutionary, rejecting the use of \r\nthe legal method of struggle, may consider himself an arch-leftist, as \r\nfor example the extreme left Social Revolutionaries considered \r\nthemselves when they disregarded the example of the Bolsheviks and \r\ncalled for a boycott of the Third State Duma. In fact they were simply \r\npaying their respects to a revolutionary phrase. But these gentlemen did\r\n not simply reject the outdated legality of the old regime: they adopted\r\n revolutionary struggle exclusively as a struggle for a new legality. \r\nThus, formal legality still remains a fetish for them. They proceed not \r\nfrom the interest of the victorious class but from abstract principles; \r\nthey cannot imagine that the policy of the proletariat (which has taken \r\npower and held on to it through a cruel civil war) is only the form of \r\nthe establishment of a new type of legality which rests upon a \r\ncorrespondingly codified law. It is wen known that the left Social \r\nRevolutionary jurists, on the day after they entered into the structure \r\nof the Soviet government, were busy drafting “a criminal code of the \r\nRevolution”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one knew how to castigate the musty and reactionary formal juridic\r\n approach to questions of the revolutionary class struggle as well as \r\nLenin. The words of Bebel were not in vain: “the jurists are the most \r\nreactionary people on earth” – this was the favourite expression used by\r\n Vladimir Ilich. It is sufficient to remember how he attacked Kautsky \r\nwhen the latter (with respect to the Soviet Constitution depriving the \r\nexploiters of the right to vote) posed the deep question: “Who is a \r\ncapitalist in the legal sense?” It is sufficient to remember his rebuke \r\nto Kautsky over the question concerning the “illegal” expulsion of \r\nSocial Revolutionaries and Mensheviks from the All-Union Central \r\nExecutive Committee, a rebuke revealing all the idiocy of legal \r\nformalism in the face of the harsh facts of class struggle:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">We, the Russian Bolsheviks, had first to promise the \r\ninviolability of Savinkovs and Co., the Lieberdans and Potresovs (“the \r\nactivists”); then draw up a criminal code declaring “punishable” any \r\nparticipation in the Czechoslovakian counter-revolutionary war, or any \r\nalliance with the German imperialists against the, workers of one’s own \r\ncountry in the Ukraine or in Georgia; and <em>only then</em>, on the \r\nbasis of the criminal code, would we have had the right according to \r\n“pure democracy” to exclude “certain persons” from the soviets. <a id=\"f15\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n15\" name=\"f15\">[15]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">What after all, in the final analysis, is the Leninist \r\ntheory of dictatorship if it is not a doctrine of revolutionary power \r\nwhich rejects formal legality? “The scientific concept of dictatorship \r\nmeans nothing less than power unlimited by anything, by any laws, \r\nunconstricted by absolute rules, and depending directly upon force.” <a id=\"f16\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n16\" name=\"f16\">[16]</a>\r\n And in another place: “The revolutionary dictatorship of the \r\nproletariat is power won and maintained by the coercion of the \r\nbourgeoisie by the proletariat.” <a id=\"f17\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n17\" name=\"f17\">[17]</a>\r\n But does not this power, confined by neither rules nor laws, signify \r\nthe absence of all organizational power? For the ingrained bourgeois \r\njurist there is no doubt that this is the case, because he does not see,\r\n and does not want to see, that bourgeois legality is the consistent \r\npractice of class domination formed over decades and centuries. This \r\nstandard “legal” form of domination can be destroyed or shaken by \r\nextraordinary events, but this still by no means signifies the necessary\r\n elimination of the organizational domination of the bourgeoisie itself \r\nIn accordance with an extraordinary situation it may adopt the form of \r\nan extraordinary and extra-legal dictatorship. And if, as we know, \r\nbourgeois legality developed gradually – because of the work of a whole \r\nlegion of parliamentarians, scholars, jurists, judges and civil servants\r\n – then it would be absurd to demand the same legal perfection and \r\nlegality from proletarian power born yesterday and having to defend its \r\nvery existence with weapons. Legality is not an empty sack that can be \r\nfilled with a new class content. But it is indeed in this way that \r\nKautsky imagines the matter. “This ‘serious scholar’ allows the English \r\nbourgeoisie centuries to construct and develop a new (for the Middle \r\nAges) bourgeois constitution, but this representative of lackey science \r\ndoes not give us, the workers and peasants of Russia, enough time. From \r\nus he demands a constitution worked out to the letter in a few months.” <a id=\"f18\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n18\" name=\"f18\">[18]</a>\r\n The revolutionary and Marxist approach to problems of law requires, \r\nabove all, an evaluation of the basic class tendencies of the upheaval \r\ntaking place. But Kautsky is not at all interested in this. He is \r\ndisturbed by the fact that, in depriving capitalists of the right to \r\nvote, our constitution therefore allows “arbitrariness”. Here is Lenin’s\r\n truly crushing answer to these pearls of formal-legal blockheadedness:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">when in the course of centuries or decades all the \r\nbourgeois and the majority of the reactionary jurists of the capitalist \r\ncountries developed detailed rules-wrote dozens and hundreds of volumes \r\nof laws and explanations of laws; oppressed the workers; enchained the \r\npoor; and placed thousands of cavils and obstructions in the path of any\r\n simple worker-then Mr. Kautsky and the bourgeois liberals do not detect\r\n “arbitrariness” here! Here, there is “order” and “legality” ... but \r\nwhen for the first time in history the working and exploited classes ...\r\n created their own soviets, called to the task of political construction\r\n those classes that the bourgeoisie had subjugated, beaten and deadened;\r\n and began themselves to build a new proletarian state, standing amidst \r\nthe dust of wild battle and in the fire of civil war, to outline the \r\nbasic principles of a state without exploiters-then all the scoundrels \r\nof the bourgeoisie, the whole band of vampires, with their echo, \r\nKautsky, began to shout about “arbitrariness”. <a id=\"f19\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n19\" name=\"f19\">[19]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">The bourgeois revolutionaries – the Jacobins – in \r\nclearing the way for capitalism also knew how to use the weapon of \r\ndictatorship mercilessly, but they could interpret their historical \r\nactions only in the false ideological form of struggling for the eternal\r\n bases of freedom and equality. They acted as daring revolutionary \r\npoliticians, but they were thinking like jurists and moralists. They \r\ndecided, for the sake of saving the bourgeois-democratic Jacobin \r\nrevolution, to trample upon formal legality, but they did this in the \r\nname of freedom, in the name of the absolute rights of man and the, \r\ncitizen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Lenin, as a follower of Marx, no social ideals existed that could\r\n not be explained in terms of the material conditions of existence, and \r\nwhich in class society did not have a class character. The idea of \r\nfreedom and equality, the idea of the eternal and inalienable rights of \r\nman is the natural law ideal. This is the lone source of support for the\r\n bourgeois jurist who is compelled, in a revolutionary period and in the\r\n name of his class interest, to abandon the ground of formal legality. \r\nThis ideal arises in connection with a specific material social content \r\nwhich is rooted in the conditions of production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one of his first works, Lenin reminds our populists of this: “Marx\r\n repeatedly points out”, he writes, “how at the foundation of civil \r\nequality, freedom of contract, and similar principles of the <em>Rechtsstaat</em>, there lie the <em>relationships between commodity producers.</em>” <a id=\"f20\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n20\" name=\"f20\">[20]</a> Lenin begins his theses on the national and colonial question with the same materialist criticism of the ideology of equality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">Bourgeois democracy is by its very nature \r\ncharacterized by an abstract or formal statement of the question of \r\nequality in general, including that of national equality. Under the \r\nappearance of the universal equality of the human personality, bourgeois\r\n democracy proclaims the formal or legal equality of the owner and the \r\nproletarian, of the exploiter and the exploited, thereby leading the \r\nsubjugated classes into the greatest deception. The idea of equality \r\nitself, <em>being a reflection of the relationships of commodity production</em> [our italics – <em>E.P.</em>]\r\n is transformed by the bourgeoisie into a weapon of struggle to oppose \r\nthe liquidation of classes, under the pretext of the supposedly absolute\r\n equality of human personalities. The real meaning of the demand for \r\nequality consists only in the demand for the elimination of classes. <a id=\"f21\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n21\" name=\"f21\">[21]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">There is no harm here in recalling that these elementary \r\npropositions of Marxist criticism were by no means so generally accepted\r\n among the individuals who thought they were Marx’s successors, as might\r\n seem at first glance. For certain representatives of the Menshevik camp\r\n “the absolute value of the legal principles of democracy” was not \r\nsubject to any doubt even at the time when they seriously considered \r\nthemselves representatives of revolutionary Marxism. Why, even at the \r\nSecond Congress, the delegate Egorov “hissed” Plekhanov, when the latter\r\n asserted that the situation is hypothetically imaginable when we, \r\nSocial Democrats, might express ourselves against the universal right to\r\n vote. And it is interesting that Martov, although not aligned with the \r\nchampions of “absolute principles”, nevertheless later (at the Congress \r\nof the League of Social Democrats Abroad) considered it necessary to \r\noffer a reservation on just this point; that Plekhanov “could avoid the \r\ndissatisfaction of some of the delegates, if he were to add that of \r\ncourse one must not imagine such a tragic state of affairs as that in \r\nwhich the proletariat, in order to secure its victory, would be forced \r\nto trample upon such political rights as the freedom of the press”. The \r\nwhole essence of Menshevism lies in this reservation. On the one hand, \r\nbeing Marxist, it is inconvenient to come forward as a champion of \r\neternal and classless principles of formal democracy; on the other hand,\r\n the real petit bourgeois nature of Menshevismin fact moves along these \r\n“classless” lines: the result is a truly tragic dissension in which they\r\n attempt to save themselves from this contradiction in the fond hope \r\nthat “of course, one cannot imagine such a tragic state of affairs”. But\r\n what can be done if this “tragic state of affairs”, despite the \r\nMenshevik hopes, nevertheless becomes an historical reality? We already \r\nhave the answer to this question; it is provided by the consistent \r\npolitical practice of Menshevism, which was nothing other than \r\nsubservience to the fetish of bourgeois democracy and an intensified \r\nstruggle against the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"link\">&nbsp;<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#top\">Top of the page</a><br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>IV</h4>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">Marxist theory relegates legal forms to a secondary and \r\neven tertiary place in social development. Economic relations develop on\r\n the basis of the specific condition of the social productive forces and\r\n are decisive in the final analysis; the direct lever pushing forward \r\nthe march of history is the class, i.e. political struggle, which itself\r\n is nothing other than “the concentrated expression of economics”; as \r\nfar as the legal formulation of economic relations and political facts \r\nis concerned, this plays a secondary and subservient role. Marxist \r\ntheory, generally speaking, has therefore given the problems of law \r\ncomparatively little attention. On the contrary, bourgeois scholarship \r\nhas developed this external formal side of social relationships with \r\nparticular enthusiasm, for, in addition to other reasons, this gives its\r\n theorists the possibility of completely avoiding consideration of the \r\nproblems of economic inequality (these are troubling because of their \r\n“materialism”). jurisprudence is therefore a safe haven. This aspect of \r\nthe matter is pointed out, incidentally, by Vladimir Ilich in his \r\narticle with respect to the last (pre-war) scholarly work of Peter \r\nStruve. “The modern bourgeoisie”, he wrote, “are so frightened by this \r\nstep [which political economy has made in the person of Marx – <em>E.P.</em>],\r\n are so disturbed by the ‘laws’ of contemporary economic evolution, \r\nwhich are so obvious and imposing, that they and their ideologists are \r\nready to discard all the classics and every kind of law if only to place\r\n ... all of them ... in the archive of jurisprudence ... along with ... \r\nsocial inequality.” <a id=\"f22\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n22\" name=\"f22\">[22]</a>\r\n In another place, characterizing this tendency of bourgeois \r\nscholarship, Vladimir Ilich formulates the secret wishes of the \r\nbourgeois theorists: “Let political economy be occupied with truisms, \r\nwith scholasticism and with the senseless struggle for facts, and let \r\nthe question of ‘social inequalities’ recede to the safer area of \r\nsocio-legal discussions; where it is easier ‘to escape’ from these \r\ntroubling questions.” <a id=\"f23\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n23\" name=\"f23\">[23]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the correct Marxist analysis of the legal form as a \r\nsuperstructure dependent upon the base may, in certain circumstances, be\r\n turned into a caricature of Marxism, into a lifeless and determinist \r\nview. Here, the superstructure emerges “by itself” upon a given base, \r\nand form appears “by itself” at a certain level of development of the \r\ngiven material content. Increasing emphasis upon the regularity of \r\nsocial development is imperceptibly transformed into the assertion of a \r\ncertain social automatism, or, as expressed in our militant political \r\njargon, into “tailism”. Lenin, being a fierce opponent of every sort of \r\ntailism, could not of course fail to combat these types of views and \r\ntheories, and to expose them as deviations from Marxism. The first type \r\nof fatalist distortion of Marxism was made, as is well known, by the \r\n“economists”. All class struggle, they affirmed, is political struggle, \r\nand so they concluded that the political potential of working class \r\nstruggle is an automatic process. The Marxist doctrine that political \r\nforms, and even forms of political struggle are inevitably engendered by\r\n their economic content, is turned by the “economists” into justifying \r\nand glorifying every sort of backwardness in the workers’ movement. The \r\nMensheviks formally repeated the same mistake, beginning with the \r\npropagation of tailism or organizational problems. “Content,” they \r\nannounced, “(i.e. the content of the political struggle) is more \r\nimportant than form; programme and tactics are more important then \r\norganization.” Here the dispute is transferred, so to speak, to a level \r\nwhich interests us. The form about which they are speaking is the legal \r\nor constitutional formulation of the Party, in which the latter appears \r\nnot only as the totality of like-minded political thinkers, but also as a\r\n formally unified whole, i.e. an aggregate of organizations. The \r\nexternal expression of unity is the hierarchy of Party institutions and \r\nthe Party Charter. The struggle which Lenin led at the Second Congress, \r\nand to which his <strong>Steps</strong> was dedicated, was also the <em><strong>struggle</strong> for the necessity of a legally formulated party organization</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here it is appropriate to note that Vladimir Ilich had available all \r\nthe necessary data, not only for theorizing on law, but also for feeling\r\n himself fully assured about where law appears in its Practic function \r\nas a formal intermediary of a particular kind of social relationship. <a id=\"f24\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n24\" name=\"f24\">[24]</a>\r\n These data, in the first place, were interpreted by the iron logic of \r\nthought characteristic of Vladimir Ilich. Being an incomparable \r\ndialectician and understanding the subordinate position of formal logic,\r\n Vladimir Ilich nevertheless gave it its deserved place. The dialectic \r\nwas never turned into fogginess and confusion by him. On the contrary, \r\nhe did not propose anything diffuse, undefined or confused. Each of his \r\nformulations was always thought out to the end; there is nothing \r\nexcessive in it, nothing which reveals a lack of theoretical clarity \r\nthat in such situations tries to shelter behind verbosity. A \r\nwell-developed mind such as his is a necessary and a sufficient \r\ncondition for being an extraordinary jurist. We recommend that anyone \r\nwho doubts this read carefully, for example, Lenin’s criticism of \r\nMartov’s draft of the Party Charter in <strong>Steps</strong>. <a id=\"f25\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n25\" name=\"f25\">[25]</a>\r\n The mastery with which Lenin exposes typical intellectual slovenliness,\r\n with respect to precise “legal” definitions, combined with lack of \r\ncontent, verbosity, pointless formalism and endless repetitions, speaks \r\nsufficiently for itself In particular, this is a clear example of the \r\nfact that Lenin’s criticism is directed against form; for by his very \r\nact of publishing Martov’s draft, his purpose was to show that a \r\nparticular nuance of substance (in the sense of the negative \r\nrelationship to centralism) – contrary to the affirmations of Martov – \r\nwas not revealed in his draft of the charter written before the \r\nCongress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The struggle at the Second Congress and after it, the debates on the \r\nfirst paragraph of the charter on centralism etc. ... all this had of \r\ncourse a certain political significance and political meaning, to be \r\nsure, revealed in full only later. But from the logical point of view \r\nthe argument flowed on the level of a different approach to the nature \r\nof the charter or, in a broad sense, the legal formulation of our Party.\r\n The opponents of Lenin simply denied the possibility of a formulation \r\nunder which the Party would have presented itself as something better \r\ndefined than the totality of persons <em>considering</em> themselves, at\r\n any given moment, members of the Party. No rules, for instance, Axelrod\r\n said, can forbid circles of revolutionary youth and individual persons \r\nfrom calling themselves Social Democrats and even considering themselves\r\n part of the Party. Lenin easily revealed the absurdity of this \r\nargument:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">to forbid one to call himself a Social Democrat is impossible and <em>pointless</em>, for this word expresses <em>directly</em>\r\n only a system of thoughts and not defined organizational relationships.\r\n To forbid certain circles and persons “to consider themselves part of \r\nthe Party” is possible and necessary when these circles and persons are \r\ndangerous for the affairs of the Party, corrupt it and disorganize it. \r\nIt would be comical to speak of the <em>Party</em> as a whole as a \r\npolitical quantity, if it could not “forbid by decree” a circle “to \r\nconsider itself part” of the whole! And why then define the procedures \r\nand conditions for expulsion from the Party? <a id=\"f26\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n26\" name=\"f26\">[26]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">To Lenin himself it appeared very early – and he emphasizes this in many places in his <strong>Steps</strong>\r\n – that the organizational opportunism of Axelrod, Martov and others is \r\nonly the inheritance of the previous (not yet outlived) age of circlism,\r\n of the age when the Party grew from a “family circle”, without a formal\r\n character, without the subordination of the minority to the majority, \r\nwithout the subordination of the part to the whole. Lenin, more than \r\nanyone, understood the tremendous significance of revolutionary \r\ncirclism, i.e. the close ideological and comradely welding of \r\nrevolutionaries based upon unconditional faith in one another. Many of \r\nthe best pages in his <strong>What is to be Done?</strong> are devoted \r\nto the clarification of this significance. But Lenin also understood \r\nthat when the Party moves out into the broad arena of political \r\nstruggle, it must supplement ideological unity with the character of \r\nexternal unity, it must put Party institutions in the place of the \r\ncircle. Lenin understood that a party which was arrested in its \r\ndevelopment at the stage of the circle would not be in a position to \r\nfulfil those tasks designated in its programme. The circle connection, \r\ninformal, without a charter, while it had great advantages, also had \r\nshortcomings that in the future would necessarily become unbearable. \r\nCustoms that grew up at this period became an impediment to further \r\ngrowth. Lenin wrote:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">To those who are accustomed to the loose dressing-gown\r\n and slippers of the Oblomov circle household, formal rules seem narrow,\r\n restrictive, irksome, petty and bureaucratic, a bond of serfdom and a \r\nfetter on the free process of the ideological struggle. Aristocratic \r\nanarchism cannot understand that formal rules are needed precisely in \r\norder to replace the narrow ties of the circle with the broad tie of the\r\n Party. It was unnecessary and impossible to formulate the internal tie \r\nof a circle or the ties between circles, for these ties rested on \r\nfriendship or on a confidence for which no reason or motive had to be \r\ngiven. The Party bond cannot and must not rest on either of these; it \r\nmust be founded on formal, bureaucratically worded rules (bureaucratic \r\nfrom the standpoint of the undisciplined intellectual), strict adherence\r\n to which can alone safeguard us from the wilfulness and caprice \r\ncharacteristic of the circles, and from the circle methods of \r\nin-fighting that go by the name of the “free process of the ideological \r\nstruggle”. <a id=\"f27\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n27\" name=\"f27\">[27]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">The sharp attacks of Lenin, as always, were explained by \r\nthe fact that he clearly saw the next and the most necessary step that \r\nat any given moment must be made by the Party, and he violently attacked\r\n those who pushed the Party backward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In answer to the announcement of the editorial board of the new <strong>Iskra</strong> that “trust is a delicate thing which cannot be hammered into the heart and the head”, Lenin noted:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">When I was a member only of a circle ... I had the \r\nright to rely only upon undefined faith ... and when I became a member \r\nof the Party I did not have the right to rely only upon an undefined \r\nlack of faith ... I was obliged to motivate my “trust or mistrust” by a \r\nformal conclusion, i.e. by reference to one or another formally \r\nestablished procedures of our programme, tactics or rules; I was obliged\r\n to follow <em>a formally prescribed</em> path for the expression of distrust, for the conduct of those views or those desires which flowed from this distrust. <a id=\"f28\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n28\" name=\"f28\">[28]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\"><strong>One Step Forward, Two Steps Back</strong>, is a \r\nbook that, in addition to all else, has profound educational \r\nsignificance. It teaches a serious responsible relationship to Party \r\naffairs and to Party organizations; it teaches not to confuse the \r\npolitical discussion which precedes the adoption of a specific decision \r\nwith endless and futile intellectual discussions; the consideration of \r\ncandidates at elections of officials of the Party with ordinary family \r\nconsiderations of how not to annoy someone; the Party with a group of \r\nfriends. This book emphasizes the strict, formal, external side of a \r\nmatter to which many of the revolutionaries of that time related \r\ncarelessly. But Vladimir Ilich knew that “in its struggle for power the \r\nproletariat has no other weapon but organization ... that the \r\nproletariat can become and inevitably will become an invincible force \r\nonly when its ideological unification, by the principles of Marxism, is \r\nconsolidated by the material unity of an organization which will weld \r\nmillions of toilers into an army of the working class” <a id=\"f29\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n29\" name=\"f29\">[29]</a>,\r\n that “the objective-maximal ability of the proletariat to unite into a \r\nclass will be realized by living people, will be realized in other ways \r\nthan in definite forms of organization” <a id=\"f30\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n30\" name=\"f30\">[30]</a>,\r\n that, accordingly, the founding and formalization (including the \r\nexternal-character aspect of this organization) is an important step \r\nforward in the history of the workers’ movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When, after the Second Congress, Lenin’s opponents had conducted a \r\nstruggle against “bureaucratic formalism”, they constructed their \r\nargument on a deeper and, it seemed, more Marxist understanding of the \r\ncourse of historical development. Lenin, of course, did not think of \r\nconcealing the fact that his organizational plan had a most definite \r\npolitical significance: to protect the Party from opportunism. Against \r\nthis, his opponents from the Menshevik camp put forth the following \r\nweighty objection. “Opportunism”, they said, “is created by more \r\ncomplex, and defined by deeper causes than some paragraph of a charter.”\r\n (Trotsky)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The problem is not”, Lenin replied, “that the paragraphs of the \r\ncharter may create opportunism, but to forge with their help a more or \r\nless sharp instrument against opportunism.” The formulae proposed by \r\nLenin, Trotsky further asserted, must be rejected, for historical \r\ndefinitions must correspond with the factual relationships. “Trotsky \r\nspeaks again as an opportunist”, Lenin responded. “Actual relations are \r\nnot dead, but live and are developing. Legal definitions may correspond \r\nto the progressive development of these relations but may also (if these\r\n definitions are bad) ‘correspond’ to regression or stagnancy.” “The \r\nlatter”, added Vladimir Ilich, “is the case with Martov.” <a id=\"f31\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n31\" name=\"f31\">[31]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opportunism on the question of organization was logically expressed \r\nin defending the primacy of “content” over form and in the placing of \r\nthe programme and tactics before adoption of the charter, of “actual \r\ndevelopment” over “legal definitions”. Lenin reveals the full \r\nmetaphysical nature of this contrast which fails to account for concrete\r\n historical conditions. That which is appropriate and correct in one \r\nstage of development becomes a crude mistake at another. Martov, \r\nspeaking in defence of the old circle approach, tried to rely upon \r\ncitations from the earlier works of Lenin, where he discussed \r\n“ideological influence” and the “struggle for influence”, and contrasted\r\n them with the “bureaucratic method of influencing with help of the \r\nRules”, and the tendency to rely on authority which, purportedly, Lenin \r\ndeveloped after the Second Congress. “Naive persons!” Lenin exclaims in \r\nthis respect, “they have forgotten that <em>formerly</em> our Party was \r\nnot a formally organized whole, but only the sum of separate groups, and\r\n therefore, no other relations except those of ideological influence \r\nwere possible between these groups. Now we have become an organized \r\nParty and this implies the establishment of authority, the \r\ntransformation of the power of ideas into the power of authority [and] \r\nthe subordination of lower Party bodies to higher Party bodies. Why, it \r\neven makes one uncomfortable”, Lenin concludes, “to have to masticate \r\nsuch rudimentary ideas for the benefit of one’s old comrades.” <a id=\"f32\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n32\" name=\"f32\">[32]</a>\r\n In this emphatic “now” is concentrated all the wisdom of the Leninist \r\ndialectic. He, so to speak, says to his opponents: you may, good \r\ngentlemen, affirm as much as you wish that content defines form, that \r\ntactical correctness is a necessary condition of organizational \r\nsolidarity, that discipline in the Party depends in the final analysis \r\non the authority of ideas etc., but now the time has come when it is \r\nnecessary to make a step further, when it is necessary to act on the \r\npremises created for ideological struggle, when it is necessary to \r\nunderstand the content of political struggle at the next stage, moving \r\ninto the new juridically finalized form of Party organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">The work of <strong>Iskra</strong> [wrote Vladimir Ilich] and the whole matter of Party organization, the whole matter of the <em>actual</em>\r\n reconstruction of the Party, could not be considered finished without \r\nrecognition by the whole Party and also of the formal confirmation of \r\ndefinite organizational ideas. The organizational character of the Party\r\n also had to fulfil this task. <a id=\"f33\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n33\" name=\"f33\">[33]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">With respect to the comments of the Menshevik <strong>Iskra</strong>, Lenin venomously notes at another place:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">Content is more important than form, and programme and\r\n tactics are more important than organization. Great and profound \r\ntruths. A programme is indeed more important than tactics, tactics are \r\nmore important than organizations. The alphabet is more important than \r\netymology, etymology is more important than syntax-but what can be said \r\nof people, who having failed the examination in syntax, now put on airs \r\nand pride themselves that they have been held back in a lower class for \r\nanother year? <a id=\"f34\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n34\" name=\"f34\">[34]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">Lenin understands a formal and centralized organization \r\nas something real, and he is not willing to dissolve it into some sort \r\nof symbolism satisfying “spiritual unity”. “The adoption of a \r\nprogramme”, stated the Menshevik <strong>Iskra</strong>, “contributes \r\nmore to the centralization of work than the adoption of rules.” “How \r\nthis banality – palmed off as philosophy – smacks”, Lenin reacts, “of \r\nthe spirit of the radical intelligentsia, and it is much closer to \r\nbourgeois decadence than to Social Democracy. Indeed in this famous \r\nphrase the word ‘centralization’ is understood in a sense which is very \r\nsymbolic.” <a id=\"f35\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n35\" name=\"f35\">[35]</a>\r\n It is characteristic that a fetishist relationship to the basis of \r\nformal democracy, which by that time was innate to Menshevism, did not \r\nprevent Martov and his adherents within the Party from placing their \r\nopinion (and the will of their circle) above the formal decision of the \r\nmajority of the Congress. Martov even cast doubt on the procedures of \r\nelections as expressions of the will of the Party: “only by replacing \r\nthe question of the social consciousness of the members of the Party and\r\n the socialist content of their work with the question of the \r\n‘reliability’ of centres invested with strong power, may we reach the \r\npoint of seeing in the act of the elections a specific expression of the\r\n will of Party.” <a id=\"f36\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n36\" name=\"f36\">[36]</a> Lenin, in the opinion of the four editors of the old <em>Iskra</em>,\r\n “gives prominence, not to internal union, but to external, formal unity\r\n exercised and protected by purely mechanical methods, by the systematic\r\n subjugation of individual initiative and independent social action.” \r\nMocking the worth of this document-which in fact recalls more a \r\npre-revolutionary district council speech on reforms (“independent \r\nsocial action”), than a resolution on internal Party questions-Lenin \r\ncontinues: “What external, formal unity were they talking about here, \r\nour Party members who had just returned from a Party Congress, whose \r\ndecisions they had solemnly proclaimed to be valid? Do they happen to \r\nknow of any method of achieving unity in a Party organized on any \r\nlasting basis, except by a Party Congress?” <a id=\"f37\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n37\" name=\"f37\">[37]</a>\r\n Lenin mercilessly dismantles the accusations of bureaucratic formalism \r\nand shows behind them are hidden only “an anarchist phrase and \r\nintellectual instability”. “You are a bureaucrat”, states Vladimir Ilich\r\n ironically, “because you were appointed by the Congress against my \r\nwishes; you are a formalist because you rely upon the formal decisions \r\nof the Congress, and not on my consent; you are acting in a grossly \r\nmechanical way because you cite the ‘mechanical’ majority at the Party \r\nCongress and disregard my wish to be co-opted; you are an autocrat, \r\nbecause you refuse to hand over the power to the snug little old band \r\nwho insist on their ‘continuity’ as a circle-all the more because they \r\ndo not like the explicit disapproval of this circle by the Congress.” <a id=\"f38\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n38\" name=\"f38\">[38]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lenin firmly led the Party to a new stage, to the organizational \r\n“instrumentalization” of its political life, fighting its way free from \r\nthose who pushed it back to the bygone stage of ideological struggle and\r\n demarcation. “Unity on questions of programme and tactics is an \r\nessential, but still insufficient condition, for Party unity and for the\r\n centralization of Party work”, explained Vladimir Ilich to his new-<strong>Iskra</strong>\r\n opponents. At once, in parentheses, he exclaims with weariness: “For \r\nheaven’s sake, what rudimentaries have to be repeated nowadays, when all\r\n concepts have been confused!” “This latter”, he continues, “requires, \r\nin addition, a unity of organization which, in a Party that has grown to\r\n be anything more than a mere family circle, is inconceivable without \r\nformal rules, without the subordination of the minority to the majority,\r\n of the part to the whole. As long as there was no unity on the \r\nfundamental questions of programme and tactics, we bluntly admitted that\r\n we were living in a period of disunity and the circle spirit; we \r\nbluntly declared that lines of demarcation must be drawn before we could\r\n unite; we did not even talk of the forms of a joint organization, but \r\nexclusively discussed the new (at that time they really were new) \r\nquestions of how to fight opportunism on programme and tactics. When, as\r\n we all agreed, this fight had already ensured a sufficient degree of \r\nunity – as formulated in the Party’s resolution on tactics – we had to \r\ntake the next step, and by common consent, we did take it, working out \r\nthe forms of a united organization that would merge all the circles \r\ntogether. But now these forms have been half-destroyed and we have \r\nregressed to anarchist conduct, to anarchist phrasemongering, and to the\r\n revival of a circle in place of a Party editorial board. And this \r\nregression is justified on the grounds that the alphabet is more helpful\r\n to literate speech than a knowledge of syntax!” <a id=\"f39\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n39\" name=\"f39\">[39]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for opponents from the new <strong>Iskra</strong> the Leninist \r\n“syntax” was unachievable, and they continued to regress towards the \r\n“alphabet”. “Discipline”, wrote Trotsky,” is sensible only up to the \r\npoint when it assures the possibility of struggling for that which you \r\nconsider right, and in the name of that for which you impose discipline \r\nupon yourself. But when attention is called in a certain way to the \r\nperspective ‘of denial of a right’, i.e. <em>denial of the right to struggle</em> for ideological influence, then the question of its existence is, for him, transformed from a <em>Rechtsfrage</em> (question of law) into a <em>Machtfrage</em>\r\n (question of force).” How can one fail to compare Trotsky’s abstract \r\nopinions after the Second Congress – on the theme of the inevitability \r\nof dissidence – with his concrete statement in 1908-1914 for “unity” \r\nwith those liquidators who had placed themselves both ideologically and \r\norganizationally outside the Party? To popularize the harmfulness of \r\nformal unity, after <strong>Iskra</strong> had laid the basis in a \r\n3-year struggle for both programmatic and tactical unity, and to raise a\r\n cry against dissidence and dissent when a whole political chasm had \r\nopened between the parties and the liquidators – this is a rare and, one\r\n may say, classical example of the complete absence of a dialectical \r\napproach to the question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"link\">&nbsp;<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#top\">Top of the page</a><br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>V</h4>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">The mistake of the “economists” and the Mensheviks was, \r\nas we saw, the same. It consisted in the failure to understand the \r\nconcrete forms of implementing the proletarian class struggle. Moreover,\r\n in both situations, their distortion of Marxism was presented as an \r\nalleged deepening of Marxist analysis, as the transfer of attention from\r\n the “external” (from “form”) to the very “essence”. Much later Vladimir\r\n Ilich had to fight with the same kind of mistake at the time of the \r\ndiscussion of the “right to self-determination”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His opponents, including the Polish comrades, having cast doubt on \r\nthis point of our programme, similarly tried to bypass the specific \r\nrequirement of a political and legal nature, the requirement put forth \r\nby the very course of the liberation struggle of the proletariat, under \r\nthe pretext that “in essence” no “self-determination” could exist under \r\ncapitalism, and that under socialism it was not necessary. The analogy \r\nbetween this line of argument and the arguments of the “economists” was \r\nnoted by Vladimir Ilich himself In his answer to the argument that \r\n“socialism eliminates all national subjugation just as it eliminates the\r\n class interest which produced it”, Lenin notes: “Why is there this \r\ndiscussion of the economic premises of the elimination of oppression? \r\nThey have been known for a long time and are indisputable. The dispute \r\nis related to one of the forms of political oppression, namely, the \r\nforceful domination of one nation by the state of another nation. This \r\nis simply an attempt to avoid political questions.” <a id=\"f40\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n40\" name=\"f40\">[40]</a>\r\n And further: “indeed our opponents have even attempted to avoid \r\nwhatever is debatable ... They wish to think neither about borders, nor \r\nin general about the state. This is a sort of ‘imperialist’ economism, \r\nsimilar to the old ‘economism’ of 1894-1902 which argued that capitalism\r\n is victorious, <em>therefore there</em> is no point in political questions.” <a id=\"f41\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n41\" name=\"f41\">[41]</a> Such a political theory is fundamentally hostile to Marxism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Returning again to this analogy, Lenin writes that “the old \r\neconomists” have turned Marxism into a caricature and have taught the \r\nworkers that only “economics” is important for Marxists. The new \r\n“economists” “think”, it seems, either that the democratic state of \r\nvictorious socialism will exist without borders (like a complex of \r\n“sensations” without matter), or that the borders will be defined only \r\nby the needs of production. In fact these borders will be determined \r\ndemocratically, i.e. according to the will and “sympathies of the \r\npopulation”. <a id=\"f42\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n42\" name=\"f42\">[42]</a> On the other hand, arguments that the right of nations to self-determination is unrealizable under capitalism and that, <em>therefore</em>, one must give it up, are, as Lenin shows, a concession to reformism. “<em>Objectively</em>\r\n their [i.e. the Polish comrades’] phrases on impossibility are \r\nopportunist, for they silently assume [that self-determination] is \r\nimpossible without a series of revolutions, as unrealizable under \r\nimperialism as under democracy.” <a id=\"f43\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n43\" name=\"f43\">[43]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lenin’s political acumen in this dispute was frequently explained and\r\n commented upon in later Marxist literature. But no one, so far as we \r\nknow, has noted the fact that logically the position of Rosa Luxemburg –\r\n and those holding views like hers (among whom spoke out even clear \r\nopportunists such as Semkovsky and the Bundist Liebman) – may be, \r\nincidentally, characterized as the complete rejection of the legal form \r\nand the complete lack of understanding of its specific features. Begin \r\nwith the fact that Comrade Lenin had constantly and firmly to explain to\r\n his opponents the difference between “the right to secession” and \r\nsecession itself Rosa Luxemburg, and indeed others, suppose that \r\nrecognition of the “right of secession” signifies obligatory support of \r\nevery concrete demand for secession, and that it inherently includes \r\n“the encouragement of separatism”. Lenin had to explain this lack of \r\nunderstanding with the elementary example of the “right to divorce”. “To\r\n blame the champions of self-determination (i.e. of the freedom of \r\nsecession, of encouraging separatism), is just as stupid and just as \r\nhypocritical as to blame the champions of freedom of divorce for \r\nencouraging the destruction of family ties.” <a id=\"f44\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n44\" name=\"f44\">[44]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was absolutely incomprehensible to the opponents of Lenin that the\r\n struggle against national oppression should find its most direct and \r\nappropriate expression in the interest of the proletariat in the demand \r\nfor the legal freedom of secession, i.e. in technical language, in the \r\nstruggle for the recognition of the corresponding “subjective right”. \r\nThe discussion relates precisely to the recognition that each nation has\r\n the “subjective right” to form an independent state. Lenin explains \r\nthis by comparing it with the slogan demanding a federal or autonomous \r\nstate structure:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">It is not hard to see that under the right to national\r\n self-determination it is impossible for the Social Democrat to \r\nunderstand either federation or autonomy. Abstractly speaking, both are \r\nsubsumed by self-determination. The right to federation is completely \r\nmeaningless, because federation is a bilateral contract. It goes without\r\n saying that Marxists cannot defend federalism in general in their \r\nprogramme. With respect to autonomy, Marxists defend not the “right to \r\nautonomy”, but autonomy <em>itself</em> as a universal principle of \r\ndemocratic states which have a mixed national composition and sharp \r\ndifferences in geographical and other factors. Therefore, to recognize \r\n“the right to national autonomy” would be just as meaningless as to \r\nrecognize “the right of nations to federation”. <a id=\"f45\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n45\" name=\"f45\">[45]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">Such a statement of the question (recognition of the \r\nright to self-determination without obligatory support of each concrete \r\ndemand for secession) was definitely not mastered by Lenin’s opponents. \r\nIt seemed “metaphysical” to them, deprived of concrete political \r\ncontent, and without practical indications for daily policy. The Bundist\r\n Liebman simply declared the right to self-determination “a fashionable \r\nexpression” whose meaning was surrounded by a haze.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thought that this essentially bourgeois-democratic (and therefore\r\n inevitably formal and abstract) slogan could be both a battle cry of \r\nthe proletariat against the semi-feudal and bourgeois materialist \r\nreaction, but could also play a positive role even after the victory of \r\nsocialism, absolutely failed to find a place in the consciousness of \r\npeople sincerely presenting themselves as consistent Marxists. It seemed\r\n to them that the empty legal abstraction of equality of right \r\ndefinitely had to be replaced by something real and practical. Lenin \r\nsplendidly exposed their mistake:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">To demand an answer “yes or no” to the question of \r\nsecession in the case of every nation may seem a requirement that is \r\nvery “practical”. But in reality it is absurd, theoretically \r\nmetaphysical, and in practice leaves the proletariat subordinate to the \r\npolicy of the bourgeoisie ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">It is theoretically impossible to guarantee in advance\r\n whether the secession of a given nation, or its equal legal position \r\nwith another nation, will culminate in a bourgeois-democratic \r\nrevolution. It is important in both cases to ensure the development of \r\nthe proletariat; the bourgeoisie impede this development and give \r\nprecedence to “national” development. Therefore, the proletariat is \r\nlimited to the “negative” demand for the recognition of the right to \r\nself-determination, which is not guaranteed to any one nation. The whole\r\n task of the proletariat on the national question “is not practical for \r\nthe national bourgeoisie of each nation, because the proletariat demands\r\n an ‘abstract’ equal right, an absence in principle of even the \r\nslightest privilege, because it is opposed to all nationalism”. <a id=\"f46\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n46\" name=\"f46\">[46]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">Lenin understood what his opponents failed to understand:\r\n that the “abstract”, “negative” demand of formal equal rights was, in a\r\n given historical conjuncture, simultaneously a revolutionary and \r\nrevolutionizing slogan, and also the best method of strengthening the \r\nclass solidarity of the proletariat and of protecting it from infection \r\nby bourgeois-national egoism. In fact, in the concrete conjuncture in \r\nwhich the argument occurred (i.e. on the eve of the Imperialist War and \r\nat its height, and thus on the eve of the Russian Revolution), to deny \r\nthe right to self-determination by proceeding from the fact that this \r\nwas just a slogan of formal democracy – and that Marxists are obliged to\r\n expose this formal democracy in every way – would have been. “to play \r\ninto the hands not only of the bourgeoisie but of feudal and absolutist \r\nnational oppression”. Lenin understood that at any stage of development,\r\n the demand for the abstract formal equality of right is a revolutionary\r\n demand which destroys the semi-feudal monarchy and in the first \r\ninstance, Russian absolutism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But then 1920 arrived. In Russia the October Revolution had already \r\noccurred and Soviet power was confirmed; the next task was to struggle \r\nfor the dictatorship of the proletariat on a world scale. The \r\nimperialist bourgeoisie and it minions firmly tried to mask their policy\r\n of oppression and robbery of conquered and colonial countries by empty \r\n“Wilsonian” phrases on the equality of peoples, on the equal rights of \r\nnations etc. Under these conditions a simple repetition of the old \r\nslogans would have been meaningless. The basic task became a struggle \r\nagainst bourgeois democracy, and the exposure of its lies and \r\nfalsehoods. Lenin wrote his famous theses on the national question for \r\nthe Second Congress of the Comintern, and they begin with the \r\nabove-cited exposure of the bourgeois democratic idea of formal legal \r\nequality. The theses emphasized that “the Communist Party, as the \r\nconscious expression of the struggle of the proletariat for the \r\noverthrow of the yoke of the bourgeoisie, must not place <em>abstract and formal</em>\r\n principles at the apex of the national question: compare with the \r\ndeclaration reproduced above that the proletariat demands abstract equal\r\n rights” [our italics – <em>E.P.</em>] First, it must consider the \r\nhistorical, concrete, and (above all) economic situation; second, the \r\nexact difference between the interests of the oppressed, exploited \r\nworking classes and the general concept of the national interest, which \r\nsignifies the interests of the ruling class; third, the clear \r\ndistinction between nations that are oppressed, dependent and lacking in\r\n equal rights, and nations that are oppressors and exploiters. These \r\ndistinctions must be counterweights to the bourgeois democratic lie that\r\n masks the enslavement of the great mass of the population of the earth \r\nby an insignificant minority of the rich advanced capitalist countries, \r\nan enslavement which is characteristic of the period of finance capital \r\nand imperialism. <a id=\"f47\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n47\" name=\"f47\">[47]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bourgeois democratic slogans on the national question have lost their\r\n revolutionary quality. The defence of the “abstract” equality of rights\r\n was a halfway house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">In the area of internal state relations the national \r\npolicy of the Comintern cannot be limited to the naked, formal and \r\npurely declarative recognition of the equal right of nations to which \r\nthe bourgeois democrats limit themselves – it makes no difference \r\nwhether they recognize themselves openly as such, or mask themselves in \r\nthe guise of socialism. <a id=\"f48\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n48\" name=\"f48\">[48]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">In turn a new task is created:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">the task of transforming the dictatorship of the \r\nproletariat from a national dictatorship (i.e. existing in one country \r\nand incapable of determining world politics) into an international \r\ndictatorship (i.e. a dictatorship of the proletariat of at least several\r\n advanced countries capable of having a decisive influence on world \r\npolitics). Petit bourgeois nationalism declares internationalism to be \r\nthe recognition of the equal rights of nations, and it only preserves \r\n(not speaking of the purely verbal character of such a recognition) \r\ninviolable national egoism. However, proletarian nationalism demands, \r\nfirst, the subordination of the interest of the proletarian struggle in \r\nany one country to the interest of the struggle on the whole world \r\nscale; second, it demands the ability and readiness on, the part of \r\nthose nations which have achieved victory over the bourgeoisie, to \r\nundertake great national sacrifices for the destruction of international\r\n capital. <a id=\"f49\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n49\" name=\"f49\">[49]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">This was a new stage, a new situation, a new and higher \r\nlevel of struggle. And new priorities corresponded to it. The \r\nbourgeois-democratic stage had passed, and with it the formal legal \r\ndemand for national self-determination – characteristic of this stage – \r\nlost its former significance. The slogan “overthrow the rule of the \r\nbourgeoisie on a world scale and set up the international dictatorship \r\nof the proletariat” became the immediate practical slogan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does this mean that national self-determination lost all \r\nsignificance; that it could be replaced with the “self-determination of \r\nthe proletariat”? Certainly not. This would have been to ignore the \r\npresence of backward countries which had not passed through the stage of\r\n bourgeois-democratic national revolutions. The communist proletariat of\r\n advanced countries had to support these movements; with all its \r\nstrength it had to struggle so that the accumulation of centuries of ill\r\n will and the distrust by backward people of the dominant nations – and \r\nof the proletariat of these nations – was overcome as quickly as \r\npossible. It was impossible to achieve this goal without proclaiming and\r\n conducting in practice the right of national self-determination. \r\nMoreover, even for a socialist society moving towards the elimination of\r\n classes the question of national self-determination still remains a \r\nreal one, since although based on economics, socialism by no means \r\nconsists solely of economics:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"quoteb\">For the elimination of national subjugation, a \r\nnecessary foundation is socialist production, but it is also necessary \r\nto have a democratic organization of the state, a democratic army etc., \r\nerected on this base. By transforming capitalism into socialism the \r\nproletariat creates the possibility of eliminating national subjugation.\r\n This possibility is transformed into reality ”only” – only upon the \r\nfull establishment of democracy in all areas, the determination of \r\nborders according to “the sympathies of the population”, and the full \r\nfreedom of secession. On this base, in its turn, the absolute \r\nelimination of the least national frictions and distrust develops <em>in practice</em>. The accelerated movement towards the integration of nations will be completed when the state <em>withers away.</em> <a id=\"f50\" href=\"https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/1925/xx/lenin.htm#n50\" name=\"f50\">[50]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"fst\">We hope that in these few examples we have shown what \r\nrich material for the study of the revolutionary dialectical approach to\r\n questions of law is contained in the theoretical and political works of\r\n Lenin. We will consider our task fulfilled if we succeed in attracting \r\nthe attention of comrades to this little-studied area.</p>", author_id: 4, category_id: 6, deleted: false, slug: "lenin-and-problems-of-law"}

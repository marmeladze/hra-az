In contrast with the spheres of private rights and private welfare (the family and civil society), the state is from one point of view an external necessity and their higher authority; its nature is such that their laws and interests are subordinate to it and dependent on it. On the other hand, however, it is the end immanent within them, and its strength lies in the unity of its own universal end and aim with the particular interest of individuals, in the fact that individuals have duties to the state in proportion as they have rights against it (see § 155).\r\n\r\nThe foregoing paragraph advises us that concrete freedom consists in the identity (as it is supposed to be, two-sided) of the system of particular interest (the family and civil society) with the system of general interest (the state). The relation of these spheres must now be determined more precisely.\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view the state is contrasted with the spheres of family and civil society as an external necessity, an authority, relative to which the laws and interests of family and civil society are subordinate and dependent. That the state, in contrast with the family and civil society, is an external necessity was implied partly in the category of ‘transition’ (Übergangs) and partly in the conscious relationship of the family and civil society to the state. Further, subordination under the state corresponds perfectly with the relation of external necessity. But what Hegel understands by ‘dependence’ is shown by the following sentence from the Remark to this paragraph:\r\n\r\n§ 261.... It was Montesquieu above all who, in his famous work L’Esprit des Lois, kept in sight and tried to work out in detail both the thought of the dependence of laws in particular, laws concerning the rights of persons - on the specific character of the state, and also the philosophic notion of always treating the part in its relation to the whole.\r\n\r\nThus Hegel is speaking here of internal dependence, or the essential determination of private rights, etc., by the state. At the same time, however, he subsumes this dependence under the relationship of external necessity and opposes it, as another aspect, to that relationship wherein family and civil society relate to the state as to their immanent end.\r\n\r\n‘External necessity’ can only be understood to mean that the laws and interests of the family and civil society must give way in case of collision with the laws and interests of the state, that they are subordinate to it, that their existence is dependent on it, or again that its will and its law appear to their will and their laws as a necessity!

It’s like bringing to \r\nlife the written texts of a convention or law. Some of the atrocities \r\nour world has paid greatest attention to are the ones that had a picture\r\n or video showing the extent of violation. These images drive down the \r\nmessage and get people uncomfortable to the point of action and that is \r\nexactly what we need as a human rights community – to provoke people to \r\ntake a stand against injustice. The field is changing and as human \r\nrights organisations we need to do less of press statements and more of \r\nvisual advocacies.</em>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>As Board member of the Global Campus Alumni, one of the \r\nbiggest professional networks on human rights composed of seven Alumni \r\nAssociations of the Global Campus Master’s programmes, what do you \r\nbelieve are today the main challenges to the work of human rights \r\nactivists? </strong></p>\r\n<p><em>There are a ton of challenges to the human rights agenda. However\r\n one which I believe to be quite critical is the threat to human rights \r\ndefenders themselves, especially from suppressive governments. While \r\nhuman rights defenders go about protecting the rights of others, they \r\nare constantly at risk of arrests, torture, and even death.

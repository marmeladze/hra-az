  {title: "Critique of Hegel's philosophy of right", image: "image/upload/v1498855210/critique-of-hegel-s-philosophy-of-right.jpg", body: " § 261. In contrast with the spheres of private rights and private welfare (the family and civil society), the state is from one point of view an external necessity and their higher authority; its nature is such that their laws and interests are subordinate to it and dependent on it. On the other hand, however, it is the end immanent within them, and its strength lies in the unity of its own universal end and aim with the particular interest of individuals, in the fact that individuals have duties to the state in proportion as they have rights against it (see § 155).\r\n\r\nThe foregoing paragraph advises us that concrete freedom consists in the identity (as it is supposed to be, two-sided) of the system of particular interest (the family and civil society) with the system of general interest (the state). The relation of these spheres must now be determined more precisely.\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view the state is contrasted with the spheres of family and civil society as an external necessity, an authority, relative to which the laws and interests of family and civil society are subordinate and dependent. That the state, in contrast with the family and civil society, is an external necessity was implied partly in the category of ‘transition’ (Übergangs) and partly in the conscious relationship of the family and civil society to the state. Further, subordination under the state corresponds perfectly with the relation of external necessity. But what Hegel understands by ‘dependence’ is shown by the following sentence from the Remark to this paragraph:\r\n\r\n§ 261.... It was Montesquieu above all who, in his famous work L’Esprit des Lois, kept in sight and tried to work out in detail both the thought of the dependence of laws in particular, laws concerning the rights of persons - on the specific character of the state, and also the philosophic notion of always treating the part in its relation to the whole.\r\n\r\nThus Hegel is speaking here of internal dependence, or the essential determination of private rights, etc., by the state. At the same time, however, he subsumes this dependence under the relationship of external necessity and opposes it, as another aspect, to that relationship wherein family and civil society relate to the state as to their immanent end.\r\n\r\n‘External necessity’ can only be understood to mean that the laws and interests of the family and civil society must give way in case of collision with the laws and interests of the state, that they are subordinate to it, that their existence is dependent on it, or again that its will and its law appear to their will and their laws as a necessity!

  {title: "Federal Law and Consumer Credit Scores", image: "image/upload/v1498854820/federal-law-and-consumer-credit-scores.jpg", body: "With the exception of your Social Security number, no other number has more of an impact on your life than the impact made by your credit score. Credit scores influence lender decisions on whether to offer you credit cards and loans for big ticket items, such as a home and automobile. Even employers use credit scores as one factor in determining the qualifications of a job applicant.\r\n\r\nThe United States has a history of favoring lender rights over consumer rights. That is, until the passage of two landmark pieces of federal legislation that protects you against credit reporting fraud.\r\n\r\nFair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)\r\n\r\nPassed in 1970 and enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Fair Credit Reporting Act ensures the accuracy, privacy, and fairness\r\nFIND MORE LEGAL ARTICLES\r\nof consumer information stored in the files created by consume credit reporting agencies. The guiding enforcement principle of the FCRA is to prevent the willful and/or negligent addition of inaccurate financial data in consumer credit reports. Under the FCRA, government oversight includes the thorough vetting of consumer credit reporting agency practices in regards to the collection and sharing of consumer credit histories.\r\n\r\nThe FCRA represented ground breaking consumer protection legislation. However, more than 40 years later, the United States Congress passed a bill that bolstered the enforcement teeth of the FCRA.\r\n\r\nFair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA)\r\n\r\nIn a study released by the FTC in 2015, nearly 25 % of consumers discovered inaccurate and/or incomplete information in their credit reports. Before 2003, consumers had no legal recourse to rectify inaccurate credit reports. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) mandates that consumers have the right to receive one free copy of their consumer credit report from each of the three major credit reporting companies (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) every 12 months. Consumers request free credit reports online via the government approved website, as well as by mail or phone. FACTA also includes legal mandates to reduce identity theft, such as providing consumers with the capability to issue alerts for their credit histories if identity theft appears to have prompted a sharp drop in their credit scores.\r\n\r\nHow Do Consumers Order Free Credit Reports?\r\n\r\nIn a collaboration with the FTC, Experian, TransUnion and Equifax created online websites to act as a central digital clearinghouse for free credit report requests. The big three credit reporting companies also have set up toll free numbers to discuss free credit report questions with consumers. You can order your free credit report once annually online or by making a request online or by calling 1-877-322-8228.\r\n\r\nIf mail is your preferred method of communication, send your free credit report request to the following address:\r\n\r\nAnnual Credit Report Request Service\r\nP.O. Box 10581\r\nAtlanta, GA 30348-5281\r\n\r\nWhat Information Do I Need to Provide for a Free Credit Report?\r\n\r\nIf you want to receive a free credit report, you need to give each of the three major credit reporting companies your name, date of birth, address, and Social Security number. Consumers that have moved within the past two years must also provide the previous address. TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax ask questions that only you know the answers to secure your account. You might have to give answers to security questions such as the name of your first school or the city where you were born.\r\n\r\nThe importance of your credit report in all facets of your life requires you to remain vigilant for fraud and other types of illegal activities that diminish your credit worthiness. The federal government has created clear guidelines to protect consumer information. It is up to you to ensure the information is complete and accurate.", author_id: 2, category_id: 3}
